Students wishing to work with someone in Kings who is not a member of the philosophy department are urged to apply directly to the relevant department for admission as a graduate student</p>\r\n<p>There are two kind of research degrees offered by this Department: Master of Philosophical Studies (MPhilStud)&nbsp;and PhD. The MPhilStud is a two-year structured research degree incorporating work on specific topics as well as a dissertation, giving the opportunity to acquire broad expertise at an advanced level. The general MPhilStud has a wide range of topics to choose from, one of which must be historical (relating to a specific philosopher or school of philosophy). There are also specialised MPhilStuds in Ancient Philosophy and in Philosophy of Psychology. These have a similar structure to the general MPhilStud but require some specific topic choices. We offer PhDs in Philosophy and Linguistics. Students admitted to the PhD programme will already have a Master's degree.</p>\r\n<p><b>Joint PhD programme</b></p>\r\n<p>The Department of Philosophy at King's is delighted to be able to offer research students two exciting options for joint-PhD study. The programmes offered provide candidates with the opportunity to divide their PhD study between two prestigious universities, enjoying full supervision at both. The programme builds on an extensive network of existing institutional links, joint teaching experience and collaborative graduate programmes between King&rsquo;s and the partners universities.<br /> <br /> The Department of Philosophy at the Humboldt University has strengths in the following research areas: Classical German Philosophy, especially Kant, Early Modern Philosophy, especially Leibniz and Locke, Philosophy of Mind (Berlin School of Mind and Brain), Ancient Philosophy (Graduate School of Ancient Philosophy) and Analytic Metaphysics. These areas complement the research in King&rsquo;s in the history of philosophy, in ancient philosophy, modern philosophy, philosophy of mind and metaphysics. We encourage applications from students who intend to write a PhD in one of these areas. The joint PhD offers the opportunity to do some graduate work in German. Hence, it should be of interest to PhD students who want to work on a German speaking philosopher.<br /> <br /> The Department of Philosophy at the National University of Singapore is a thriving community with 16 full-time tenured or tenure track faculty members. In addition, there are more than thirty graduate students pursuing the PhD and Masters in philosophy. Its faculty members engage in research in a wide range of fields, including Moral and Practical philosophy, Continental European, Buddhist, Indian, Chinese and Comparative Philosophy. It thus offers a range of study options for potential PhD students that complement well King's own research strengths in, for example, ancient philosophy, modern philosophy, philosophy of mind and metaphysics.

Joint PhDs available: Exciting opportunities to gain a joint PhD with the National University of Singapore and the Humboldt University in Berlin. We offer close personal supervision to students in a wide variety of areas, with particular strengths in the history of philosophy, philosophy of mind and psychology, metaphysics and philosophy of science, ethics and politics, and philosophy of language and linguistics. Philosophy postgraduates are normally supervised within the philosophy department. Students wishing to work with someone in Kings who is not a member of the philosophy department are urged to apply directly to the relevant department for admission as a graduate student There are two kind of research degrees offered by this Department: Master of Philosophical Studies (MPhilStud) and PhD. The MPhilStud is a two-year structured research degree incorporating work on specific topics as well as a dissertation, giving the opportunity to acquire broad expertise at an advanced level. The general MPhilStud has a wide range of topics to choose from, one of which must be historical (relating to a specific philosopher or school of philosophy). There are also specialised MPhilStuds in Ancient Philosophy and in Philosophy of Psychology. These have a similar structure to the general MPhilStud but require some specific topic choices. We offer PhDs in Philosophy and Linguistics. Students admitted to the PhD programme will already have a Master's degree. Joint PhD programme The Department of Philosophy at King's is delighted to be able to offer research students two exciting options for joint-PhD study. The programmes offered provide candidates with the opportunity to divide their PhD study between two prestigious universities, enjoying full supervision at both. The programme builds on an extensive network of existing institutional links, joint teaching experience and collaborative graduate programmes between King’s and the partners universities. The Department of Philosophy at the Humboldt University has strengths in the following research areas: Classical German Philosophy, especially Kant, Early Modern Philosophy, especially Leibniz and Locke, Philosophy of Mind (Berlin School of Mind and Brain), Ancient Philosophy (Graduate School of Ancient Philosophy) and Analytic Metaphysics. These areas complement the research in King’s in the history of philosophy, in ancient philosophy, modern philosophy, philosophy of mind and metaphysics. We encourage applications from students who intend to write a PhD in one of these areas. The joint PhD offers the opportunity to do some graduate work in German. Hence, it should be of interest to PhD students who want to work on a German speaking philosopher. The Department of Philosophy at the National University of Singapore is a thriving community with 16 full-time tenured or tenure track faculty members. In addition, there are more than thirty graduate students pursuing the PhD and Masters in philosophy. Its faculty members engage in research in a wide range of fields, including Moral and Practical philosophy, Continental European, Buddhist, Indian, Chinese and Comparative Philosophy. It thus offers a range of study options for potential PhD students that complement well King's own research strengths in, for example, ancient philosophy, modern philosophy, philosophy of mind and metaphysics. Students would spend a significant portion of their time in Singapore, thereby enabling them to access expertise in fields of philosophy where King's alone would not be able to offer supervision.

The Department's Placement Officer provides training for advanced research students in preparing them for the academic job market. Visit our admissions webpages to view our  English language entry requirements. MPhilStud:  a Bachelor's degree with 1st class honours (or overseas equivalent) in which philosophy was the major component. Particularly strong candidates with a high 2:1 (above 65%), or equivalent classification, may also be considered. Applicants who are currently undertaking a Master's degree may be expected to achieve a Distinction. Strong candidates who do not strictly meet the published requirements may be admitted at the discretion of the department of Philosophy.  MPhil/PhD:  Master's degree in Philosophy (or in Linguistics for those intending to complete Linguistics research) with Distinction (or equivalent) is normally expected but particularly strong candidates with a Merit (or equivalent) classification are also eligible. All first-year research students attend the first-year research seminar which once a week. All other research students attend a weekly thesis-reading/advanced-research-methods seminar. The department has a computer room and a graduate common room. Many of our PhDs go on to academic work in philosophy (see the Placement Record on our website). Others go into teaching, management or the financial or public sector. Applicants for the Joint PhD programme must contact the relevant departments at both universities before submitting an application in order to discuss the suitability of their topic for the joint programme and to locate potential supervisors. Applications should initially be submitted to the proposed home institution only, ie where the student will start and finish their programme. Students should note that acceptance onto the programme may take slightly longer than for single-institution PhDs because of the additional steps involved. Further details, including FAQs, can be found on the  King's Worldwide web pages . Applicants who choose King’s as their home institution should apply through the online system, selecting the appropriate Joint PhD option from the drop-down list. In addition to the standard supporting documentation, applicants should submit a Travel Plan form indicating how they intend to divide their time between the two partner institutions. Students must spend a specified amount of time in each institution, details of which can be found in the ‘Notes’ section of the Travel Plan form. It is recommended that students submit applications for the Joint PhD programme by the end of March to begin the following September.

Completed applications will be accepted at any time prior to the start of the degree programme. However, early applications are encouraged particularly as deadlines for outside funding can fall several months before entry. You should include a detailed outline of a proposed research project (500-1,000 words). The deadlines for applications are detailed below. Once the final deadline passes for a start month in 2018, we will open the applications for the corresponding month in 2019. Please note that funding deadlines may be earlier.   April 2018 entry – Application deadline: 18 th February 2018 for Overseas/Home/EU students September 2018 entry – Application deadline: 27 th July 2018 for Overseas students and 31 st August for Home/EU students January 2019 entry – Application deadline: 26 th October 2018 for Overseas students and 3 rd December 2018 for Home/EU students April 2019 entry – Application deadline: 15 th February 2019 for Overseas/Home/EU students To ensure that you develop the skills necessary to complete your research programme and fulfil your career goals, the Department will provide you with research training in accordance with the specific guidelines set out by ESRC for human geography and NERC for physical geography. During induction you will meet with your primary supervisor to assess your skills and training needs and design an individualised training programme for you, which is set out in a research plan that must be approved by the Departmental Postgraduate and Research Committee (PaRC). Although the specific training programmes provided for physical geography and human geography students differ somewhat, both use a variety of means, including lectures and practical classes, individual reading and study, and informally through discussion with other graduates. Visit our admissions webpages to view our  English language entry requirements. Bachelor’s degree with 1st class or 2:1 honours (or overseas equivalent) and/or a good Master's degree. Those applying for one of the joint degree programs are encouraged to contact an academic at King's to develop research links with the partner institution. Students applying for the joint PhD programme with Humboldt University may be required to hold a Master’s degree in order to meet the requirements of Humboldt University. We believe that individualised tuition from a committee of supervisors who are themselves experts in your chosen research area is the foundation for PhD programme of study. Accordingly you will meet regularly with a primary and secondary supervisor. In the first year you will have at least three formal meetings and a minimum of two each year thereafter to discuss the biannual student training and research progress reports. In addition you will usually have more informal meetings with your primary supervisor, fortnightly in the first year, and as often as necessary thereafter to discuss work. Contact with part-time students is generally less frequent, depending on individual circumstances, although regular progress meetings are required. Students go on to become lecturers and research assistants, directors and senior managers of international consultancies, lawyers, consultants for environmental agencies, governments, charities and research organisations. Applicants for the Joint PhD programme must contact the relevant departments at both universities before submitting an application in order to discuss the suitability of their topic for the joint programme and to locate potential supervisors. Applications should initially be submitted to the proposed home institution only, ie where the student will start and finish their programme. Students should note that acceptance onto the programme may take slightly longer than for single-institution PhDs because of the additional steps involved. Further details, including FAQs, can be found on the  King’s Worldwide web pages . Applicants who choose King’s as their home institution should apply through the online system, selecting the appropriate Joint PhD option from the drop-down list. In addition to the standard supporting documentation, applicants should submit a Travel Plan form indicating how they intend to divide their time between the two partner institutions. Students must spend a specified amount of time in each institution, details of which can be found in the ‘Notes’ section of the  Travel Plan form . It is recommended that students submit applications for the Joint PhD programme by the end of March to begin the following September.

The Centre for Stem Cells & Regenerative Medicine (CSCRM), in the Faculty of Life Sciences & Medicine at King’s College London, hosts the Wellcome Trust Cell Therapies and Regenerative Medicine Four-Year PhD Programme . Six fully funded studentships, including salary and university fees, are available with a start date in September to provide in-depth postgraduate training to highly motivated students of any nationality (open to applications from mid-October to early January. Please see programme webpages for exact dates each year). The goal of this programme is to train a new generation of researchers in regenerative medicine. Year 1 Students undertake 12-week rotations in three different laboratories which they will select from a list of supervisors participating in the programme. Supervisors have been selected across King’s campuses for their expertise in core areas of relevance to regenerative medicine. In addition to lab based projects, students will also attend experimental skills workshops (e.g. statistics and imaging), lectures in cell therapy and will also have the opportunity to write a scientific review for potential publication. Year 2 to 4 Students will choose one of their rotation projects to further develop into their thesis work for the final three years of the programme. Each student will have the opportunity to undertake an internship (ranging from a few days to three months) to enhance lab skills; provide exposure to different working environments (including the commercial sector); foster collaborations and stimulate interdisciplinary research. Career Options Students will take part in classes and evening talks to gain perspectives on diverse aspects of a research career and regenerative medicine. Presenting their work in multiple settings including an international conference will further aide networking opportunities. Access to King’s Researcher Development Unit will further enable graduation with excellent career prospects. Funding for this programme is provided by the Wellcome Trust (5 studentships) and King’s College London (1 studentship). In addition to all university fees being paid in full (for students of any nationality), the student will receive a generous stipend. Please see the programme webpages for further details.

Before submitting an application, it is best to make informal email contact with a potential supervisor. Please consult the ‘People’ section of our website for details of staff expertise and publications. Then you can gain some initial feedback on your proposed topic, see who in the Department might be best placed to supervise your project and find out whether they are taking on new students. If you are unsure who to contact, please get in touch with the Postgraduate Research Lead on english@kcl.ac.uk. Admission to our research programmes will initially be for the MPhil but we expect students to transfer to the PhD after between 12 and 18 months (or part time equivalent)  by agreement with their supervisor and the Departmental Postgraduate and Research Committee. This process is called the ‘upgrading’ and involves submission of a dossier followed by an informal interview with their second supervisor and another member of the Department.  A key part of your application is your research proposal. Here are some guidelines on writing a successful proposal: Writing your PhD Proposal…. takes time! You should expect to write it over a number of weeks, involving fresh research, feedback from friends and a tutor, and careful polishing. There is no specific format for the proposal, but around 2-4 pages (1000-2000 words) is recommended. is a crucial part of your application, which is mainly judged on the quality of your ideas, more than on any personal qualities or previous experience.  Your independent development of a strong proposal is the first test of your ability to do a successful PhD. need only be indicative: you don’t need to have written the book before applying for the PhD. Everyone knows that applicants are expressing an interest in an area rather than mastery of it, and that projects change a lot over the three years of studying. But you should describe a project that excites you personally at the time of applying. Things to include : Title: is it clear and appealing? Does it contain keywords and suggest your project’s place in a recognisable field of scholarship? Would it point us to a suitable supervisor without too much difficulty? Clear statement on what you want to work on and why it is important and exciting . What questions will you be addressing? Is there a lack in the existing research area that you can identify? Are you showing an ambition to make an intervention in the broader field of English studies? Background knowledge and clear reference to existing research in this area. If you have found a research ‘gap’ you could say where the other relevant debates appear to stop. Some discussion of the methods you might use, and why you are using them An indication of the research strategy and a rough timeframe of key milestones Key primary and secondary references, presented according to an academic convention. This can either be throughout the text, in footnotes, or in a final short bibliography. Applicants are also asked to submit an essay of not more than 5,000 words, preferably on a topic related to their chosen research topic. Applicants who completed their MA or BA more than 10 years ago will normally be expected to submit a new piece of work. Funding Many of our incoming students apply for AHRC funding via the London Arts and Humanities Partnership.  Please see their website ( www.lahp.ac.uk ) for more detail of deadlines, application procedure and awards available. Also the ‘Student Funding’ section of the Prospectus will give you more information on other scholarships available from King’s. The deadlines for applications are detailed below. Once the final deadline passes for a start month in 2018, we will open the applications for the corresponding month in 2019. Please note that funding deadlines may be earlier.   April 2018 entry – Application deadline: 18 th February 2018 for Overseas/Home/EU students September 2018 entry – Application deadline: 27 th July 2018 for Overseas students and 31 st August for Home/EU students January 2019 entry – Application deadline: 26 th October 2018 for Overseas students and 3 rd December 2018 for Home/EU students April 2019 entry – Application deadline: 15 th February 2019 for Overseas/Home/EU students Exciting opportunities are available to undertake a joint PhD programme either with Hong Kong University (HKU), the National University of Singapore (NUS) or Humboldt in Berlin. There are a number of areas where research expertise at King’s overlaps with our partnerships with these international institutions, enabling excellent supervisory teams for students. The fields of post colonialism, performance studies/drama, modernism, and 18th-19th century literature are especially strong across all our partners, but the full breadth of literary studies can usually be accommodated via our joint programmes. In undertaking a joint degree, students have access to studying in vibrant international contexts, making the research experience a rich and rewarding one. FAQs about joint PhDs can be found on the King’s Worldwide web pages. There is a range of induction events and training provided for students by the Graduate School, the Faculty of Arts and Humanities and the English Department. A significant number of our students are AHRC-funded through the London Arts and Humanities Partnership (LAHP) which also provides doctoral training to all students. All students take the ‘Doctoral Seminar’ in their first year. This is a series of informal, staff-led seminars on research skills in which students can share and gain feedback on their own work. We run a series of ‘Skills Lunches’, which are informal lunch meetings with staff, covering specific topics, including Upgrading, Attending Conferences, Applying for Funding and Post-Doctoral Awards, etc. Topics for these sessions are generally suggested by the students themselves, so are particularly responsive to student needs. We have an Early Career Staff Mentor who runs more formal workshops of varying kinds, particularly connected to career development and the professions (for example, ‘Applying for Jobs’ and ‘How to Write an Academic CV’). Furthermore, individual research groups within the department also provide various forms of trainings, including ‘Work in Progress’ sessions, in which students raise research/methodology questions related to their own projects. Through our Graduate Teaching Assistantship Scheme, doctoral students are given the opportunity to teach in the department (usually in their second year of study) and are trained and supported as they do so.   Visit our admissions webpages to view our  English language entry requirements. General entry advice Applicants should normally have: A Bachelor's degree with 1st Class honours  in English (or international equivalent) or  a Master of Arts  in English with High Merit - 65% or higher in the UK system (or international equivalent) Those applying for one of the joint degrees are encouraged to contact an academic at King's to develop research links with the partner institution. Students applying for the joint PhD programme with Humboldt University may be required to hold a Master’s degree in order to meet the requirements of Humboldt University. We place great emphasis on pastoral care and are a friendly and welcoming department. Our home in the new Virginia Woolf Building offers many spaces for postgraduate students to work and socialise. Studying in London means students have access to a huge range of libraries from the Maughan Library at King’s to the Senate House Library at the University of London and the British Library. In addition, archives and special collections abound: for instance The Women’s Library at LSE. The department hosts a number of vibrant research seminars series and symposia open to all graduate students. In addition, there is a student-led graduate seminar series called ‘The Abstract’  and an online journal which allow students to present, discuss and publish their work. We also organise an annual graduate conference attended by students and staff in the department which provides a friendly and supportive forum in which research students can give papers on their work. Students are encouraged to organise their own events, with Departmental and College support. Our research students have continued in academia, or have developed their skills in teaching, journalism, cultural arts and management, or the legal and financial sectors. Applicants for the Joint PhD programme must contact the relevant departments at both universities before submitting an application in order to discuss the suitability of their topic for the joint programme and to locate potential supervisors. Applications should initially be submitted to the proposed home institution only, ie where the student will start and finish their programme. Students should note that acceptance onto the programme may take slightly longer than for single-institution PhDs because of the additional steps involved. Further details, including FAQs, can be found on the  King’s Worldwide web pages . Applicants who choose King’s as their home institution should apply through the online system, selecting the appropriate Joint PhD option from the drop-down list. In addition to the standard supporting documentation, applicants should submit a Travel Plan form indicating how they intend to divide their time between the two partner institutions. Students must spend a specified amount of time in each institution, details of which can be found in the ‘Notes’ section of the  Travel Plan form . It is recommended that students submit applications for the Joint PhD programme by the end of March to begin the following September.

Over the last two decades, there have been tremendous advances in our understanding of the molecules and principles that govern the functioning of the nervous system. Great progress has been made to understand the molecular basis of disease states and pain, and the molecular mechanisms that limit regeneration. These advances enable innovative neuroscience and the opportunity to translate new knowledge into clinical benefits. Our mission is to: Further understand the causes of neuropathic disease, identify new drug targets, develop treatments and monitor outcomes; Study synaptic receptors and neuronal signalling mechanisms to promote symptomatic relief from the pain and dysfunction associated with a damaged nervous system; Develop and test strategies aimed at restoring function to the damaged nervous system by promoting cell survival and forming new synaptic connections or neurons. Much of our thinking is driven by the emerging hypothesis that the brain does indeed have an intrinsic ability to limit damage associated with brain injury ultimately go beyond symptomatic relief. Within the division our aim is to advance knowledge in our subject matter through collaborative multidisciplinary studies that use core resources including bioinformatics and expression profiling of proteins. Our expertise ranges from genetic, biochemical and bioinformatic approaches for novel gene discovery, molecular modelling of protein-protein interactions, cell biology to whole animal approaches to study neuronal survival and regeneration and observational studies at the level of the whole animal. In addition, we have experience in running clinical trials in stroke and dementia. We will focus our activities around three major themes, but emphasise that the interests of most PIs cut across the themes.and disease and to repair itself by regenerative and compensatory mechanisms.
