Until these eligibility criteria are changed, the EU tuition fee will remain the same as the UK tuition fee.  These tuition fees may be subject to additional increases in subsequent years of study, in line with King’s terms and conditions. Deposit When you receive an offer for this course you will be required to pay a non-refundable deposit to secure your place. The deposit will be credited towards your total fee payment. The UK/EU deposit is £500. The INTERNATIONAL deposit is £2,000.  If you receive an offer on or before 31st March 2018, payment is due by 27th April 2018. If you receive an offer between 1st April 2018 and 30th June 2018, payment is due within one month of receiving the offer. If you receive an offer between 1st July 2018 and 31st July 2018, payment is due within two weeks of receiving the offer. If you receive an offer on or after 1st August 2018, payment is due within one week of receiving the offer. If you are a current King’s student in receipt of the  King's Living Bursary  you are not required to pay a deposit to secure your place on the programme. Please note, this will not change the total fees payable for your chosen programme. Additional costs/expenses In addition to your tuition fees, you can also expect to pay for:  Books if you choose to buy your own copies  Fieldwork and/or laboratory materials Clothing for optional course related events and competitions  Library fees and fines  Personal photocopies  Printing course handouts  Society membership fees  Stationery  Travel costs for travel around London and between campuses  Some modules include the option to undertake other short day-trip fieldwork. These fieldwork options will enhance the modules, but they are not assessed as part of the module. The additional costs for short day-trip fieldwork would typically not exceed £50 per year.  Costs may be incurred for dissertation work if fieldwork and/or laboratory materials are needed for the chosen study topic, but such work is not mandatory and would not impact academic success if an alternative approach to dissertation research is taken. Graduation costs Please visit our web pages on  fees and funding  for more information. Teaching We use lectures, seminars and group tutorials to deliver most of the modules on the course. You will also be expected to undertake a significant amount of independent study. Typically, one credit equates to 10 hours of work. Per 20-credit module:  Lectures, seminars and feedback: Typically 20 hours. Self-study: 180 hours (some modules in the Geography Department may involve lab work or e-learning which would require less selfguided learning).  Dissertation:  Lectures, seminars and feedback: Usually four dissertation workshops/tutorials and five contact hours of one-to-one or group consultation with supervisors. Self-study: 587 hours of self-study and project work. Assessment Performance on taught modules in the Geography Department is normally assessed through essays and other written assignments, oral presentations, lab work and occasionally by examination, depending on the modules selected. All students also undertake a research-based dissertation of 12,000 words. The Climate Change: History, Culture, Society MA course provides you with the theories, methods and skills required to analyse climate change, and the responses it generates among different national, political and social groupings. The course encourages you to examine historical, cultural and social perspectives on climate change, enabling you to gain a better understanding of how people in different settings around the world make sense of climate change. The course information sheet is a printable version of the information on this web page, which you can download here . Courses are divided into modules. You will normally take modules totalling 180 credits. King’s College London reviews the modules offered on a regular basis to provide up-to-date, innovative and relevant programmes of study. Therefore, modules offered may change. We suggest you keep an eye on this course page for updates.
