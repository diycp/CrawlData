Through this Classical Art & Archaeology MA you will examine painting, pottery, sculpture and mosiaics and explore the craftsmanship that produced archologically significant works.  Traditionally, classical archaeology has focused on the art history of Classical Greece and Italy, but has more recently branched out geographically and chronologically. Archaeology has also become more theoretical in recent decades. This course explores the relationship between humans and their material environment.  We consider engagement in field projects as essential for the continuing health of the discipline. All trends are well represented here at King's.  Classical Art & Archaeology at King's Our expert staff cover wide range of specialisms including Bronze Age,  Aegean, Byzantine Cyprus, Roman Britain, Persian monuments, Greek pottery and Roman mosaics, while many other staff members employ art historical and archaeological methods in their work. London has been a centre for the collection and display of ancient art and artefacts for many centuries, a cultural engagement that has in turn had a great influence on British heritage. There is a strong commitment at King's to exploring the role that ancient art and archaeology has had and continues to have in this local context of a global capital. MA Classical Art & Archaeology The MA course consists of a wide range of optional modules and a research dissertation. The compulsory colloquium, Undertaking Research in Classical Archaeology, taken as preparation for writing the dissertation, provides particularly concentrated training in research techniques and methodology. Modules are taught both with texts in the original languages and with translated texts. If you intend to pursue further research in classical archaeology or art history, you may find particular value in the unique opportunities to acquire technical skills in the handling of documentary evidence provided by modules in Greek Papyrology, Greek & Roman Epigraphy, and Greek & Latin Palaeography. As well as archaeological and art-historical topics, students can also choose modules from other MA programmes at King's, including Ancient History, Classics, and Late Antique & Byzantine Studies. Students also have the opportunity to study Latin and Ancient Greek. The MA programme in Classical Art & Archaeology is organised on an intercollegiate basis, combining the expertise of staff in all three of the participating colleges - King's, UCL and Royal Holloway. It centres on the University's Institute of Classical Studies, which not only contains a world-class research library, but also hosts the richest programme of seminars, conferences, and occasional lectures for this subject area in the UK. Research seminars In the Department of Classics we run a  research seminar series  (which MA students are encouraged to attend), where you will learn about the current research of our academic staff and PhD students.  The Department regularly hosts  major research conferences with speakers from around the world . There are also University of London research seminars organized through the Institute of Classical Studies, for example in Literature, Classical Archaeology and Ancient History, where you will be able to listen to and meet leading scholars from around the world. There is also the  Late Antique & Byzantine Studies seminar , which is organized by the Centre for Hellenic Studies. Personal tutor We will assign you a personal tutor in the Department of Classics, who will advise you and help you decide which modules to take, and can answer any questions or concerns you may have whilst at King's. Dissertation supervision During your first term at King's you will need to decide on your MA dissertation subject, if you have not done so before you arrive. The dissertation can be related to work you are doing for a taught module, or it can be in a completely different area. On the basis of your chosen subject area you will be assigned a supervisor within the Department of Classics who will discuss the topic with you, and oversee your work on it.

Teaching You will typically have 20 hours of teaching per 20-credit taught module as well as 180 hours of self-study (some modules may involve lab work or e-learning which would require less self-guided learning). Typically, one credit equates to 10 hours of work. For the dissertation module, you will have 16 contact hours of workshops and one-to-one or group consultation with supervisors to complement 584 hours of self-study and project work. If you are taking the part time course, you will take at least 60 credits of required modules during your first year, and take the remaining credits and your dissertation in your second year. This can, however, be individually discussed with the student. Assessment Russia Institute modules will be assessed by essays, other written work (including policy briefs and memoranda, scenario analyses and models), timed written exams, in-class quizzes and presentations, and class participation and attendance. Most 20-credit modules will have a volume of assessment equivalent to a 4,000 word essay, but this may be distributed over several different assessments. The dissertation module assessment will be 100 per cent on the dissertation itself (14,000 words); a 1,000-word dissertation proposal is required but not assessed. Assessment of modules from other departments/institutes may vary. Our Russian Politics & Society MSc focuses on contemporary political, economic and social policy challenges. You will gain detailed knowledge of the interconnected reform challenges that have faced Russia in recent decades, a comprehensive knowledge of Russian current events, and an understanding of a range of disciplinary and theoretical approaches to policy and academic analysis.

All our teaching staff are therefore research-active, many enjoying international reputations as leaders in their fields. Our commitment to original research means that we can introduce students to new discoveries in a diverse range of fields being explored by our staff. If you are a full-time student, each week we will provide six to eight hours of teaching through lectures and seminars. We will expect you to undertake 34 hours of independent study. If you are a part-time student, each week we will provide two to four hours of teaching through lectures and seminars. We will expect you to undertake 17 hours of independent study. Typically, one credit equates to 10 hours of work. Assessment Methods of assessment vary between modules, but typically involve the submission of some coursework (usually an essay) and a written examination. A few modules are assessed through only one of these methods.   Overview In this distinguished MA degree, students can tap into our rich tradition of excellence in textual, theological and philosophical study while also gaining perspective on ways religion shapes and is shaped by the contemporary world. Attracting students from around the globe, the MA in Religion offers an outstanding range of teaching from internationally leading scholars, with the option to follow one of four pathways of study or to forge your own path. The course information sheet is a printable version of the information on this web page, which you can download here . You will have the choice of four pathways that can be tailored to your interests. If you wish to gain a deeper understanding of religion in the contemporary world from political, sociological and anthropological perspectives, follow the Religion in Contemporary Society pathway. For a comprehensive understanding of Christian thought and practice as it has been reasoned and debated over the centuries, take the Systematic Theology pathway. The Biblical Studies pathway introduces students to the world, text and context of the Bible in antiquity and in the modern world, reading it as literature and as a theological text. The Jewish Studies pathway opens up the richness of Jewish texts and experience from antiquity to modern times, with particular attention to current issues in multi-religious societies. Courses are divided into modules. You will normally take modules totalling 180 credits. Applications must be made online using King’s online application portal  apply.kcl.ac.uk  and a non-refundable application fee of £55 applies. Your application will be assessed by at least two academic members of staff. We aim to process all complete applications within four to six weeks, although this may take longer in February and March, and over holiday periods.

It provides a critical understanding of arts and cultural management for graduates seeking a career in arts management or for professionals wishing to enhance their existing knowledge and career prospects.  Applicants must submit both a personal statement and a new piece of academic writing (details below). The personal statement should explain why you wish to apply for this programme and why you feel it matches your interests, academic background, and, if relevant, your career plans. The personal statement should be a maximum of 500 words, if you submit a personal statement which is longer than this it will not be accepted, and you will be required to submit a shorter version, thus delaying application assessment. The piece of writing you should submit must address ONE of the following options, and should be 2,000 words in length: 1.            Write a reflective piece about a current issue in arts management 2.            Should governments subsidise the arts? Explain your answer using relevant examples to illustrate your points. Your essay will demonstrate your ability to: •             Investigate the topic/question •             Source apposite material •             Undertake original research •             Construct a coherent argument. Use appropriate evidence and source material to support your arguments, such as textbooks, journal articles, newspaper articles and internet sources. Please include AT LEAST five sources. Ensure that you cite these using the Harvard referencing system and provide a full bibliography at the end of your essay. We will be using plagiarism software to check that your essay has not been submitted by another student or to another institution, either in whole or in part; if you are found to have plagiarised then your application will be immediately rejected.

Teaching The study time and assessment methods detailed above are typical and give you a good indication of what to expect. You can typically expect: the equivalent of over 50 days of academic sessions at King’s (typically three hours in the morning and/or afternoon spread throughout the academic year) approximately 120 days of teaching placement.* This includes a short primary school observation of four days. five to seven tutorials across the year two visits from a tutor whilst on placement to observe lessons and monitor progress regular** meetings with a mentor, who will be a member of staff at your placement school, whilst on placement written feedback on all credit-bearing assignments within four weeks of the deadline. * This 120 day figure represents the standard number of placement days. In certain cases, following assessment by course tutors and mentors, students may be required to undertake a greater number of placement days to demonstrate their ability to meet the Teacher Standards. ** Typically each trainee will have a meeting with their mentor during each week they are on placement. In certain circumstances the frequency may vary. The types of learning commitment encompassed within the course vary depending on modules. For this course one credit represents the equivalent of 10 hours of learning and engagement. Professional Practice in Education (45-credit module) This module covers the teaching practice that students carry out in secondary schools. As such, much of the time commitment is dedicated to teaching and planning lessons.  Seminars/tutorials: 14 contact hours (seminars/tutorials designed to evaluate teaching performance and provide feedback). Teaching: 200-220 hours of teaching (this includes time teaching by oneself and ‘team teaching’ in groups). Self study/assignment work: 216 hours to include lesson planning, observing lessons, marking pupils work. School Data (15 credit module) Lectures/seminars: 10 contact hours Self-study/ assignment work: 140 hours Studying Policy & Professional Practice (30-credit module) Lectures/seminars: 25.5 contact hours Self-study/assignment work: 274.5 hours of self-study Focused Pedagogical Studies (30-credit module) Lectures/seminars: 200 contact hours. Self-study/assignment work: 100 hours of self-study Assessment The 45-credit honours-level module will be assessed by a combination of a written portfolio (equivalent to 8,000 words) and assessment of your teaching practice against the Teaching Standards as set out by the government’s Department for Education. Progress in meeting the teaching standards will be monitored through three progress reports that will be completed by staff at the placement school. The 30-credit master’s-level modules will each be assessed by a written assignment of 6,000 words heavily based on in-school research that trainees undertakes. The 15 credit honours-level module will be assessed by an assignment focusing on data collection methods in the school environment. Location Students undertake placements in secondary schools that work in partnership with King’s College London. Partnership schools are located across central London and the Greater London area. Whilst every effort is made to place PGCE trainees in local schools, due to the changing nature of initial teacher education and limited availability of placements in certain subject areas, trainees should be prepared to travel to their placement schools throughout the Greater London area and beyond. Students also organise their own short placement at a state primary school. Further information on this short placement is provided during the course. Our PGCE provides a clear, thoughtful and critical introduction to teaching Latin with Classics, drawing on leading education research carried out at King's. We work in close partnership with schools in designing, delivering and assessing our programme in order to develop excellent, reflective classroom practitioners.

Hold an undergraduate degree with high 2:1 honours (i.e. overall average of at least 65%) in Law or a degree with at least 70% law content, or an equivalent international qualification and grading. A guide to international equivalencies at King's by country can be found here .  OR 2.
