Prof Terry Dawson ( terry.dawson@kcl.ac.uk )   Please note: Current regulations allow some students to pay UK tuition fees on the basis of their EU citizenship or residency. Until these eligibility criteria are changed, the EU tuition fee will remain the same as the UK tuition fee.  These tuition fees may be subject to additional increases in subsequent years of study, in line with King’s terms and conditions. Deposit When you receive an offer for this course you will be required to pay a non-refundable deposit to secure your place. The deposit will be credited towards your total fee payment. The UK/EU deposit is £500. The INTERNATIONAL deposit is £2,000.  If you receive an offer on or before 31st March 2018, payment is due by 27th April 2018. If you receive an offer between 1st April 2018 and 30th June 2018, payment is due within one month of receiving the offer. If you receive an offer between 1st July 2018 and 31st July 2018, payment is due within two weeks of receiving the offer. If you receive an offer on or after 1st August 2018, payment is due within one week of receiving the offer. If you are a current King’s student in receipt of the  King's Living Bursary  you are not required to pay a deposit to secure your place on the programme. Please note, this will not change the total fees payable for your chosen programme. Additional costs/expenses In addition to the costs above, you can also expect to pay for:  Books if you choose to buy your own copies  Clothing for optional course related events and competitions  Library fees and fines  Personal photocopies  Printing course handouts  Society membership fees  Stationery  Graduation costs Travel costs for travel around London and between campuses  Some modules include the option to undertake other short day-trip fieldwork. These fieldwork options will enhance the modules, but they are not assessed as part of the module. The additional costs for short day-trip fieldwork would typically not exceed £50 per year.  Costs may be incurred for dissertation work if fieldwork and/or laboratory materials are needed for the chosen study topic, but such work is not mandatory and would not impact academic success if an alternative approach to dissertation research is taken. Please visit our web pages on  fees and funding  for more information. http://www.kcl.ac.uk/geography/study/masters/modules.aspx Teaching We will teach you through a combination of lectures and seminars, and you will typically have 20 hours of this per module. We also expect you to undertake 180 hours of independent study for each module. For your 12,000 word dissertation, we will provide four workshops and five hours of one-to-one supervision to complement your 587 hours of independent study. Typically, one credit equates to 10 hours of work. Assessment Performance on taught modules in the Geography Department is normally assessed through essays and other written assignments, oral presentations, lab work and occasionally by examination, depending on the modules selected. All students also undertake a research-based dissertation of 12,000 words. Our Environmental Monitoring, Modelling and Management MSc is a multidisciplinary course that will give you a deeper understanding of the processes and techniques for managing environmental change. You will develop skills to assess the causes and manage the consequences of environmental, climatic and land use changes, choosing either a research or a consultancy pathway to frame your study. The course information sheet is a printable version of the information on this web page, which you can download here. Students take either a Research stream or a Consultancy stream. Courses are divided into modules. You will normally take modules totalling at least 180 credits. King’s College London reviews the modules offered on a regular basis to provide up-to-date, innovative and relevant programmes of study. Therefore, modules offered may change. We suggest you keep an eye on the course finder on our website for updates.

Key benefits Your studies will focus on the delivery of essential technical skills (GIS, Remote Sensing, modelling and monitoring). You will form close links with departmental research groups and external organisations in the UK and beyond. Choose to study a research or consultancy pathway. The Environmental Monitoring, Modelling and Management MSc course offers advanced-level core training in environmental modelling and monitoring, remote sensing and Geographical Information Systems (GIS), and in the research methods required to use them effectively. You will examine how to assess the causes and consequences of environmental, climatic and land-use change, with the choice to follow a research pathway or a consultancy pathway. The two paths share key training elements but offer modules designed to support career development in two distinct spheres: The research path will link you with a departmental research group working on research aspects of environmental modelling and monitoring, and is designed explicitly for those going on to a career in research. The consultancy pathway focuses on the application of fundamental training for environmental management and is for those wanting to use their skills directly in environmental management. The course is made up of optional and required modules. You will be expected to obtain the minimum of 180 credits to complete the course. If you are studying full-time, you will complete the course in one year, from September to September. If you are studying part-time, your course will take two years to complete. You will take the combination of required and optional modules over this period of time, with the dissertation in your second year.

School Data (15 credit module) Lectures/seminars: 10 contact hours Self-study/ assignment work: 140 hours Studying Policy & Professional Practice (30-credit module) Lectures/seminars: 25.5 contact hours Self-study/assignment work: 274.5 hours of self-study Focused Pedagogical Studies (30-credit module) Lectures/seminars: 200 contact hours. Self-study/assignment work: 100 hours of self-study Assessment The 45-credit honours-level module will be assessed by a combination of a written portfolio (equivalent to 8,000 words) and assessment of your teaching practice against the Teaching Standards as set out by the government’s Department for Education. Progress in meeting the teaching standards will be monitored through three progress reports that will be completed by staff at the placement school. The 30-credit master’s-level modules will each be assessed by a written assignment of 6,000 words heavily based on in-school research that trainees undertakes. The 15-credit honours-level module will be assessed by an assignment focusing on data collection methods in the school environment. The study time and assessment methods detailed above are typical and give you a good indication of what to expect. Location Students undertake placements in secondary schools that work in partnership with King’s College London. Partnership schools are located across central London and the Greater London area. Whilst every effort is made to place PGCE trainees in local schools, due to the changing nature of initial teacher education and limited availability of placements in certain subject areas, trainees should be prepared to travel to their placement schools throughout the Greater London area and beyond. Students also organise their own short placement at a state primary school. Further information on this short placement is provided in the offer holder pack and during the course.   Our Computing PGCE is designed to allow computing professionals and graduates to become inspiring secondary school teachers. The course emphasises learning through critical reflection on theory, practice and discussion with colleagues. The course covers topics such as how pupils learn, how assessment can improve learning and teaching, how to plan and deliver outstanding lessons. The course information sheet is a printable version of the information on this web page, which you can download here for PGCE Computing, and  here  for the PGCE Computing: School Direct Route. Trainees reach Qualified Teacher Status and are awarded the Postgraduate Certificate in Education, which gives 60 credits at master's level. These can be put towards completing an MA with one further year of part-time study. Courses are divided into modules, and students on this course take modules totalling 120 credits. King’s College London reviews the modules offered on a regular basis to provide up-to-date, innovative and relevant programmes of study. Therefore, modules offered may change.

Applicants must have experience enabling them to teach computer science theory and practice to GCSE level and information technology to A-level. Enhancement courses: If your degree is in information technology but your knowledge of computer science is limited you may be asked to complete a one to six-month subject knowledge enhancement (SKE) course. You have to secure a place on a PGCE course before you can start SKE, and SKE typically starts in May or July, so you are advised to apply early for the PGCE. For further guidance, see our detailed FAQs.  GCSE grade C or above  (or an equivalent qualification)  in English language and mathematics . Applicants without these English or mathematics qualifications at the time they apply may be considered, but they must obtain them, or pass an equivalent test set by King's, before the course starts.

Jayne Kranat Please note: Current regulations allow some students to pay UK tuition fees on the basis of their EU citizenship or residency. Until these eligibility criteria are changed, the EU tuition fee will remain the same as the UK tuition fee.  These tuition fees may be subject to additional increases in subsequent years of study, in line with King’s terms and conditions. Additional costs/expenses In addition to your tuition fees, you can also expect to pay for:  Books, if you choose to buy your own copies  Clothing for optional course related events and competitions Course packs, which are a vital part of your learning at King's and normally contain extracts from books and other useful documents that will inform your study. Library fees and fines  Personal photocopies  Printing course handouts  Society membership fees  Stationery  Travel costs for travel around London and between campuses  Travel costs in getting to and from placement schools Travel costs for three group trips to schools in the Greater London Area Graduation costs Please visit our web pages on fees and funding for more information. The National College of Teaching and Leadership provides tax free bursaries for teacher training courses. Bursaries range from £4,000-£30,000 depending on the subject area you are training in and your academic qualifications. For information on rates and eligibility please visit  getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/funding-and-salary/overview  or contact the King’s Admissions Office. King’s will automatically assess your eligibility for a bursary when a place on a PGCE course is offered. King’s will apply for the funding on your behalf once the terms of your offer have been met and you have enrolled on the course.     Teaching You can expect the following: The equivalent of 56 days of academic sessions at King’s (typically three hours in the morning and or afternoon spread throughout the academic year) Approximately 120 days of teaching placement.*  This includes a short period of placement in primary schools (typically between five and nine days in length). Five to seven personal tutorial sessions across the year. Two visits from a tutor whilst on placement to observe lessons and monitor progress. Regular** meetings with a mentor, who will be a member of staff at your placement school, whilst on placement. Written feedback on all credit-bearing assignments within four weeks of the deadline. * This 120 day figure represents the standard number of placement days. In certain cases, following assessment by course tutors and mentors, students may be required to undertake a greater number of placement days to demonstrate their ability to meet the Teacher Standards. ** Typically each trainee will have a meeting with their mentor during each week they are on placement. In certain circumstances the frequency may vary. Professional Practice in Education (45-credit module) This module covers the teaching practice that students carry out in secondary schools. As such, much of the time commitment is dedicated to teaching and planning lessons.  Seminars/tutorials: 14 contact hours (seminars/tutorials designed to evaluate teaching performance and provide feedback). Teaching: 200-220 hours of teaching (this includes time teaching by oneself and ‘team teaching’ in groups). Self study/assignment work: 216 hours to include lesson planning, observing lessons, marking pupils work. School Data (15 credit module) Lectures/seminars: 10 contact hours Self-study/ assignment work: 140 hours Studying Policy & Professional Practice (30-credit module) Lectures/seminars: 25.5 contact hours Self-study/assignment work: 274.5 hours of self-study Focused Pedagogical Studies (30-credit module) Lectures/seminars: 200 contact hours. Self-study/assignment work: 100 hours of self-study Assessment •The 45-credit honours-level module will be assessed by a combination of a written portfolio (equivalent to 8,000 words) and assessment of your teaching practice against the Teaching Standards as set out by the government’s Department for Education. Progress in meeting the teaching standards will be monitored through three progress reports that will be completed by staff at the placement school. The 30-credit master’s-level modules will each be assessed by a 6,000 written assignment heavily based on in-school research that trainees undertakes. The 15-credit honours-level module will be assessed by an assignment focusing on data collection methods in the school environment. Location Students undertake placements in secondary schools that work in partnership with King’s College London. Partnership schools are located across central London and the Greater London area. Whilst every effort is made to place PGCE trainees in local schools, due to the changing nature of initial teacher education and limited availability of placements in certain subject areas, trainees should be prepared to travel to their placement schools throughout the Greater London area and beyond. Students also organise their own short placement at a state primary school. Further information on this short placement is provided during the course. We work in close partnership with schools in designing, delivering and assessing our programme. You will have the opportunity to work with tutors who are actively engaged in research and are encouraged to take a critical view of policies and practice. The course information sheet is a printable version of the information on this web page, which you can download here for PGCE Mathematics, and  here  for the PGCE Mathematics: School Direct Route. Trainees reach Qualified Teacher Status and are awarded the Postgraduate Certificate in Education, which gives 60 credits at master's level. These can be put towards completing an MA with one further year of part-time study. Courses are divided into modules, and students on this course take modules totalling 120 credits. King’s College London reviews the modules offered on a regular basis to provide up-to-date, innovative and relevant programmes of study. Therefore, modules offered may change. We suggest you keep an eye on this course page for updates.  http://www.kcl.ac.uk/sspp/departments/education/study/pgce/pgcefaqs.aspx Applications are made through the central national system for applying for teacher training courses. UCAS-Teacher Training, Rosehill New Barn Lane Cheltenham GL52 3LZ Tel: +44 (0)1242 544 788 www.ucas.com   Visit our admissions webpages to view our  English language entry requirements. General entry advice Our PGCE programmes all require a minimum of the following: 2:1 bachelor's degree (or international equivalent ) in single mathematics or joint honours where half of the study is in mathematics. Physics is considered equivalent to mathematics and some computing and engineering courses can be acceptable but only if there is a strong pure mathematics element. A single honours in engineering would not usually be suitable. We will consider first degrees with some mathematics content less than the requirement if candidates are able to take a mathematics enhancement course,  which is a 22-week fully funded course starting in the January of the course year. Please address your willingness to take a mathematics enhancement course in your application if applicable.  Knowledge and understanding of the subject you intend to teach.  Applicants must have detailed knowledge and understanding of the subject you intend to teach, which is up to full A-level Mathematics. We require a  high grade in at least one A-level mathematics  (or equivalent) GCSE grade C or above  (or an equivalent qualification)  in English language and mathematics . Applicants without these English or mathematics qualifications at the time they apply may be considered, but they must obtain them, or pass an equivalent test set by King's, before the course starts. For further guidance see our  detailed  FAQs for PGCE Mathematics Key benefits The PGCE course at King’s is rated Outstanding by Ofsted with excellent and knowledgeable staff on hand to support you through your training. You have the opportunity to work with tutors who are actively engaged in research in their subject and about teaching. Strong relationships between King’s and the teaching schools that make up the King’s Teacher Training Partnership. The Partnership offers a broad range of schools in London and beyond, providing unique opportunities to learn how to teach a diverse range of students. Located in the heart of London. Our course at King’s is run by a team of wellqualified tutors who have substantial experience of teaching in school and in training teachers, both in-service and initial training, and who are also engaged in current research activity of international quality. The team use their skills to create a supportive environment that challenges each student to become the best teacher they can be. University based: you will work with other trainees and tutors in your subject area to consider the principles and practice of teaching your subject including curriculum design, the development of materials, classroom management and lesson planning. You will also work with trainees from other subjects in a programme of lectures and seminar groups to examine a broad range of educational issues. During both secondary school placements there are occasional days in college for tutorials to support and monitor progress towards the standards for Qualified Teacher Status (QTS). There are cross-curricular research tasks and assignments. School based: for 24 of the 37 weeks the training takes place in schools, mainly in two complementary secondary schools but with one short primary school experience. This introduces you to recognising key constituents of good teaching, helps develop your own teaching skills and gain an understanding of how schools work and how children learn.
