International requirements   Visit our admissions webpages to view our International entry requirements. English Language requirements Band B Visit our admissions webpages to view our  English language entry requirements. Key benefits Reputed teaching team made up of senior academics with a strong practitioner background, giving the specialist LLM its strength and credibility. Wide-ranging selection of modules, many unique in this area, covering fields which are major practice areas in global and regional law firms in major financial centres and with investment banks. Opportunities to listen to and meet with a range of guest speakers, including partners from global law firms. The International Financial Law LLM focuses on the law, documentation and legal issues affecting major transactions in global financial markets (International loans and Bonds, International Project Finance, Derivatives and Securitisations), corporate mergers and acquisitions and their regulations under key legal regimes (EU, US and the UK), as well as international investment. It will give you an in-depth understanding of many of the cutting edge transactions in this field (eg credit derivative structures and synthetic securitisations) as well as the volume of anticipated regulatory law now being enacted both in the EU and in the US in response to the financial market crisis of 2008. It will also cover allied legal disciplines strongly related to these topics such as Comparative Corporate Insolvency. The LLM is strongly oriented towards a problem-solving approach, both as to legal rules and their practical use. It consequently has a clear practice orientation, but also employs critical analysis of the law and its development to the issues of the global financial market.

Teaching You will typically have 20 hours per 20-credit taught module as well as 180 hours of self-study (some modules may involve lab work or e-learning which would require less self-guided learning). Typically one credit equates to 10 hours of work. For the dissertation module, you will have 16 contact hours of one-to-one or group consultation with supervisors and workshops to complement 584 hours of self-study and project work. If you are taking the part-time course, you will take at least 60 credits of required modules during your first year, and take the remaining credits and your dissertation in your second year, although this can be individually discussed with the student. Assessment Russia Institute modules will be assessed by essays, other written work (including policy briefs and memoranda, scenario analyses and models), timed written exams, in-class quizzes and presentations, and class participation and attendance. Most 20-credit modules will have a volume of assessment equivalent to a 4,000-word essay, but this may be distributed over several different assessments. The dissertation module assessment will be 100 per cent on the dissertation itself (14,000 words); a 1,000-word dissertation proposal is required but not assessed. Assessment of modules from other departments/institutes may vary. Our Eurasian Political Economy & Energy MSc focuses on the political and economic analysis of the extraction, production and export of energy in Eurasia. You will gain in-depth knowledge of the interconnected challenges facing the energy sector – and more broadly political, economic and social actors – in Russia, Central Asia, the Caucasus and Europe, and an understanding of a range of disciplinary and theoretical approaches to policy and academic analysis. The course information sheet is a printable version of the information on this web page, which you can download here . Courses are divided into modules. You will normally take modules totalling 180 credits. King’s College London reviews the modules offered on a regular basis to provide up-to-date, innovative and relevant programmes of study.

Your six clinical modules will be examined on case reports, with oral and clinical examinations, and clinical examinations on unseen patients. Your research module will be assessed by a project report and oral examination. The study time and assessment methods detailed above are typical and give you a good indication of what to expect. However, they may change if the course modules change.   Entry to the programme is strictly dependent upon occupational health clearance that you are able to conduct exposure prone procedures (EPPs) before you start clinical work. This will assess your hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis C antibody status, HIV and TB status following the completion of a health questionnaire and a further health check before or at enrolment. If offered a place on the course, overseas students are advised to be tested locally and send the results of these checks with the questionnaire, prior to a separate full test in the UK at the College's Occupational Health Department before term begins. All offers of a place on a programme are made subject to a satisfactory criminal conviction disclosure. If you are from overseas or have never lived in the UK before, you should contact the relevant authorities in your home country to arrange for the equivalent check to be conducted and/or a certificate of good conduct to be issued.
