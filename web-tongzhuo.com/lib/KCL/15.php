The Postgraduate Diploma in CBT for psychosis (CBTp) is designed for qualified mental health practitioners and covers both the clinical skills and theoretical background required to become an innovative and successful practitioner of CBTp. We recommend completion of the programme on a part-time basis, over two years. A fast-track one year full time option is available for students with previous experience of relevant clinical work and masters level study. The Postgraduate Certificate in Therapy Skills emphasises the clinical skills component of the programme, for mental health practitioners who are primarily concerned with clinical practice, rather than academic development. The Postgraduate Certificate in Theoretical Background is designed for people without a mental health qualification, for researchers or academics, or as an introduction to CBTp. Students attend seminars and workshop teaching in order to acquire a detailed understanding of psychological models and interventions, together with their evidence base, but clinical supervision is not usually provided. Certificate programmes are offered on a part-time basis over a calendar year.  Please detail your previous training in, and experience of working with people with psychosis and of providing therapy, both to people with psychosis and in other settings. This should include type of therapy (e.g. CBT or Supportive Counselling), approximate numbers of clients worked with and length of therapy. Courses are divided into modules. You will normally take: Postgraduate Diploma – modules totalling 120 credits Postgraduate Certificate – modules totalling 60 credits   The required modules vary depending on the qualification. You are required to choose from the following modules: Therapy Skills I: Assessment & Formulation (30 credits) Therapy Skills II: Intervention & Supervised Practice (30 credits) Theoretical Background I: Psychological Models (30 credits) Theoretical Background II: Interventions Efficacy & Future Directions (30 credits) Supervisory Practice I: Supervised Practice in CBT for Psychosis (30 credits) Supervisory Practice II: Supervision, Training & Dissemination (30 credits) Graduates go on to deliver specialised CBT for Psychosis within their clinical services. Career progression to therapy practitioner or supervisor/manager/trainer is common following successful completion of the course. Academic training equips graduates with the skills to develop their own research ideas and to undertake teaching in their local institutions. Qualification for practitioner accreditation with the British Association for Behavioural and Cognitive Psychotherapies (BABCP) after successfully completing the programme will depend upon your prior experience.

Key benefits The Internationally renowned centre for the development and evaluation of cognitive behavioural interventions for people with psychosis, offers unrivalled access to current innovations in practice and research. Close supervision with expert practitioners develops students' ability to become skilled and creative independent practitioners of CBT for Psychosis. Develops students' skills in training and supervising other professionals and thus improves the provision of CBT for Psychosis in students' own work settings. The courses have been developed with the South London & Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust (SLaM) and designed in accordance with the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence Schizophrenia Guideline psychological therapy recommendations (NICE, 2003, 2014). The purpose of the courses is to improve the delivery of cognitive behavioural interventions for people with psychosis. CBTp is a complex therapeutic intervention and requires of independent practitioners an advanced theoretical understanding of cognitive models of psychosis and specialist post-qualification skills in relationship building, assessment, formulation and intervention. Our courses train students in each of these requirements, enabling them to develop competence then mastery in therapy delivery, and to provide consultancy, training and supervision to others. The courses are modular, following a credit framework. Two clinical skills modules build from early therapy activities (Engagement, Assessment & Formulation – Module 1) through to intervention and specialised applications (Intervention & Supervised Practice; Module 2) . Two academic modules develop students’ critical appraisal of the theory underlying psychological models of psychosis ( Theoretical background I: Psychological Models, Module 3) and the evidence base for interventions (Theoretical Background II: Interventions, efficacy & future directions, Module 4) . Diploma students complete all four modules; clinical skills certificate students complete Module 1 and Module 2 only; theoretical background certificate students complete Modules 3 and Module 4 only.  Click here for a diagram showing the module structure of the programme .  Case supervision is strongly emphasised on the clinical programmes. Weekly morning supervision sessions take place in small groups (four to five) on the teaching day with all supervision carried out by the programme team. Additional close supervision (listening to audio recordings of therapy sessions) is a course requirement.

The primary method of assessment for this course is a combination of essays, project work, class participation, and/or exams. The dissertation module assessment will be assessed solely on the dissertation (100%).   You will learn how states and their governments communicate in international politics and how they shape long term strategies in a range of fields from military to diplomatic to aid and development. This includes preparing for conflict between states or with insurgent groups, communicating a path during hostilities, transitioning through post-conflict situations and also how states use diplomacy, culture and economics to avoid conflict and engage in treaty and trade negotiations. You will also encounter crisis communications: how to shape strategic responses to natural disasters, terror attacks, and military invasions. To appreciate this complex field from multiple perspectives, students will further discover how insurgent and revolutionary movements think about and put into practice their communications strategies with populations and states. Along with subject matter expertise, students will develop transferable analytic, research and practical skills in a dynamic and rigorous intellectual environment. The course is associated with the King's Centre for Strategic Communications (KCSC) - a global network of universities, government agencies and alumni.

Our Early Modern History MA bridges the division between British and European history that exists on many courses, focusing on ways in which cultural, political and social themes stretch across the period c.1500–1800. The course is taught by experts in the histories of the Reformation and the Enlightenment, gender, the material world of the Renaissance, race and racism, and on Britain, Ireland, France, the Netherlands, Portugal and the Iberian world. Their research connects the political and the social, the cultural and the religious dimensions of the early modern world, and our course will give you interdisciplinary perspectives on early modern history. You will write a dissertation at the end of your course, but you will begin by testing concepts such as identity, mentality, religion; by challenging models of change including modernization, state-building, the civilising process, reformation, enlightenment and revolution; and by trying out different methodologies such as cultural history, gender, thinking with material objects, global history, using digital data. Our optional modules offer you different perspectives on religion, society, politics and culture, by examining primary sources of all kinds alongside the most recent historiographical interpretations. We will also develop your practical skills through modules such as advanced historical skills, including palaeography, Latin from beginner to advanced levels, and offer the chance to learn a European language. The flexibility of the course means that you can also take relevant modules from other departments in, for example, early modern English or French literature, the Iberian world and Digital Humanities.

Coordinated study programme with the PharmaTrain and the Faculty of Pharmaceutical Medicine of the Royal College of Physicians curricula. The first UK course that complies with both the PharmaTrain initiative of the European Commission and the Bologna Process, and is the PharmaTrain Centre of Excellence.   Clinical Pharmacology is the study of how drugs influence human physiology and the way the body responds. This study forms a vital part of the clinical development of new medicines and requires an advanced understanding of pre-clinical science, as well as the ethical and legal requirements for specialist research programmes. A well-designed clinical pharmacology programme informs the final regulatory of a new medicine. Therefore, generating skilled clinical pharmacologists is critical for the efficiency of future drug development. This course will provide you with a broad knowledge and understanding of the drug development process and the medical aspects of the marketing of pharmaceutical products. You will also have opportunities to undertake advanced research projects and the possibility of one or more thesis publications. The study programme is made up of optional and required modules. The MSc pathway requires modules totalling 180 credits to complete the programme, including 60 credits from a dissertation of around 15,000 - 18,000 words. The Postgraduate Diploma pathway will require modules totalling 120 credits, while the Postgraduate Certificate will require you to study modules totalling of 60 credits to complete the course. If you are studying full-time, you will complete the course in one year, from September to September. If you are studying for the MSc qualification part-time, your programme will take up to four years to complete. The Postgraduate Diploma and Certificate pathways are both part-time courses. The Postgraduate Diploma will take two to three years to complete and the Postgraduate Certificate up to two years.

Teaching The following table will give you an idea of what a typical year might look like as you progress through your studies: Year    Lectures, seminars and feedback    Self-study/research    Supervised clinical practice   Year 1     441 hours per year 147 hours per year 294 hours per year Year 2 147 hours per year 294 hours per year 441 hours per year Assessment Two taught modules, covering the scientific and clinical basis of maxillofacial and craniofacial technology, usually assessed by unseen written examination;   One clinical module, involving supervised clinical practice and examined by a mixture of case studies on treated and unseen patients, a clinical/technical log and an oral examination;   One research module, involving the submission of a research project report including a literature review, with an oral defence of the research.   The study time and assessment methods detailed above are typical and give you a good indication of what to expect. However, they may change if the course modules change.   Entry to the programme is strictly dependent upon occupational health clearance that you are able to conduct exposure prone procedures (EPPs) before you start clinical work. This will assess your hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis C antibody status, HIV and TB status following the completion of a health questionnaire and a further health check before or at enrolment. If offered a place on the course, overseas students are advised to be tested locally and send the results of these checks with the questionnaire, prior to a separate full test in the UK at the College's Occupational Health Department before term begins. All offers of a place on a programme are made subject to a satisfactory criminal conviction disclosure. If you are from overseas or have never lived in the UK before, you should contact the relevant authorities in your home country to arrange for the equivalent check to be conducted and/or a certificate of good conduct to be issued.

Key benefits The programme at King's is challenging and students are encouraged to take a critical view of policies and practice. Located in the heart of London. It is a sociable course where you will be expected to work with others, discussing issues and problems about teaching. You have the opportunity to work with tutors who are actively engaged in research in their subject and about teaching. Subject specialisms available in:  Biology   Chemistry   Computer Science   English   Latin with Classics   Mathematics   Modern Foreign Languages  Physics   Physics with Mathematics   Religious Education   The programme combines the theory and practice of education. We work in close partnership with schools in designing, delivering and assessing our course.  College based: You will work with other trainees and tutors in your subject area to consider the principles and practice of teaching your subject including curriculum design, the development of materials, classroom management and lesson planning. You will also work with trainees from other subjects in a programme of lectures and seminar groups to examine broad generic issues. During both secondary school placements there are occasional days in college for tutorials to support and monitor progress towards the standards for Qualified Teacher Status (QTS). There are cross-curricular research tasks and assignments.  School based: For 24 of the 36 weeks the training takes place in schools, mainly in two complementary secondary schools but with two short primary school experiences. This introduces you to recognising key constituents of good teaching, helps develop your own teaching skills and gain an understanding of how schools work and how children learn. Some Modern Languages trainees undertake part of their teaching practice in France, Spain, Austria or Germany, funded by the Erasmus programme. https://www.kcl.ac.uk/study/postgraduate/apply/enquiry-form.aspx ","type":"PGT"},"entryTitle":"Postgraduate Certificate in Education","sys":{"id":"006ce8bb-0000-0000-0000-000000000000","uri":"/api/delivery/projects/website/entries/006ce8bb-0000-0000-0000-000000000000","projectId":"website","contentTypeId":"courses","dataFormat":"entry","language":"en-GB","metadata":{},"properties":{},"version":{"createdBy":"SearchDataImport","created":"2018-01-26T18:05:55.6941242Z","modifiedBy":"SearchDataImport","modified":"2018-01-26T18:05:55.6941242Z","publishedBy":"SearchDataImport","published":"2018-01-26T18:05:56.0066079Z","versionNo":"1.0"},"owner":"SearchDataImport"}},{"title":"Computer Systems Engineering with Management","description":"<p>Our Computer Systems Engineering with Management MSc is a flexible study pathway that prepares science and engineering graduates who have excellent computer programming skills for managerial careers in computer systems engineering, robotics or and the IT sector.

The National College of Teaching and Leadership provides tax free bursaries for teacher training courses. Bursaries range from £4,000-£30,000 depending on the subject area you are training in and your academic qualifications. For information on rates and eligibility please visit  getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/funding-and-salary/overview  or contact the King’s Admissions Office. King’s will automatically assess your eligibility for a bursary when a place on a PGCE course is offered. King’s will apply for the funding on your behalf once the terms of your offer have been met and you have enrolled on the course. Teaching You can typically expect: the equivalent of over 50 days of academic sessions at King’s (typically three hours in the morning and/or afternoon spread throughout the academic year) approximately 120 days of teaching placement.* This includes a short period of placement in primary schools (typically four days) a number of one to one tutorials totaling five to seven sessions across the year two visits from a tutor whilst on placement to observe lessons and monitor progress regular** meetings with a mentor, who will be a member of staff at your placement school, whilst on placement written feedback on all credit-bearing assignments within four weeks of the deadline. *This 120 day figure represents the standard number of placement days. In certain cases, following assessment by course tutors and mentors, students may be required to undertake a greater number of placement days to demonstrate their ability to meet the Teacher Standards. **Typically each trainee will have a meeting with their mentor during each week they are on placement. In certain circumstances the frequency may vary. The types of learning commitment encompassed within the course vary depending on modules. For this course one credit represents the equivalent of 10 hours of learning and engagement. Professional Practice in Education (45-credit module) This module covers the teaching practice that students carry out in secondary schools. As such, much of the time commitment is dedicated to teaching and planning lessons.  Seminars/tutorials: 14 contact hours (seminars/tutorials designed to evaluate teaching performance and provide feedback). Teaching: 200-220 hours of teaching (this includes time teaching by oneself and ‘team teaching’ in groups). Self study/assignment work: 216 hours to include lesson planning, observing lessons, marking pupils work. School Data (15 credit module) Lectures/seminars: 10 contact hours Self-study/ assignment work: 140 hours Studying Policy & Professional Practice (30-credit module) Lectures/seminars: 25.5 contact hours Self-study/assignment work: 274.5 hours of self-study Focused Pedagogical Studies (30-credit module) Lectures/seminars: 200 contact hours. Self-study/assignment work: 100 hours of self-study Assessment The 45-credit honours-level module will be assessed by a combination of a written portfolio (equivalent to 8,000 words) and assessment of your teaching practice against the Teaching Standards as set out by the government’s Department for Education. Progress in meeting the teaching standards will be monitored through three progress reports that will be completed by staff at the placement school. The 30-credit master’s-level modules will each be assessed by a written assignment of 6,000 words heavily based on in-school research that trainees undertakes. The 15-credit honours-level module will be assessed by an assignment focusing on data collection methods in the school environment. The study time and assessment methods detailed above are typical and give you a good indication of what to expect. Location Students undertake placements in secondary schools that work in partnership with King’s College London. Partnership schools are located across central London and the Greater London area. Whilst every effort is made to place PGCE trainees in local schools, due to the changing nature of initial teacher education and limited availability of placements in certain subject areas, trainees should be prepared to travel to their placement schools throughout the Greater London area and beyond. Students also organise their own short placement at a state primary school. Further information on this short placement is provided in the offer holder pack and during the course. Our PGCE English course gives trainees practical and theoretical ideas on the teaching of English as well as modelling ways in which English can be taught in the classroom. Trainees benefit from the college’s unique location on the South Bank and are encouraged to visit the nearby Globe Theatre, Tate Modern and the Saison Poetry Library.

Teaching You can typically expect: The equivalent of over 50 days of academic sessions at King’s (typically three hours in the morning and/or afternoon spread throughout the academic year). Approximately 120 days of teaching placement.* This includes a short period of placement in primary schools (typically four days). A number of one to one tutorials totaling five to seven sessions across the year. Two visits from a tutor whilst on placement to observe lessons and monitor progress Regular** meetings with a mentor, who will be a member of staff at your placement school, whilst on placement. Written feedback on all credit-bearing assignments within four weeks of the deadline. * This 120 day figure represents the standard number of placement days. In certain cases, following assessment by course tutors and mentors, students may be required to undertake a greater number of placement days to demonstrate their ability to meet the Teacher Standards. ** Typically each trainee will have a meeting with their mentor during each week they are on placement. In certain circumstances the frequency may vary. The types of learning commitment encompassed within the course vary depending on modules. For this course one credit represents the equivalent of 10 hours of learning and engagement.   The breakdown below gives you an idea of the likely workload you can expect:  Professional Practice in Education (45-credit module): This module covers the teaching practice that students carry out in secondary schools. As such, much of the time commitment is dedicated to teaching and planning lessons.  Seminars/Tutorials: 14 contact hours (seminars/tutorials designed to evaluate teaching performance and provide feedback). Teaching: 200-220 hours of teaching (this includes time teaching by oneself and ‘team teaching’ in groups). Self study/assignment work: 216 hours to include lesson planning, observing lessons, marking pupils work.   School Data (15-credit module): Lectures/seminars: 10 contact hours. Self-study/assignment work: 140 hours.   Studying Policy & Professional Practice (30-credit module): Lectures/seminars: 25.5 contact hours. Self-study/assignment work: 274.5 hours.   Focused Pedagogical Studies (30-credit module): Lectures/seminars: 200 contact hours. Self-study/assignment work: 100 hours.   Assessment The 45-credit honours-level module will be assessed by a combination of a written portfolio (equivalent to 8,000 words) and assessment of your teaching practice against the Teaching Standards as set out by the government’s Department for Education. Progress in meeting the teaching standards will be monitored through three progress reports that will be completed by staff at the placement school. The 30-credit master’s-level modules will each be assessed by a 6,000 word written assignment heavily based on in-school research that trainees undertake. The 15-credit honours-level module will be assessed by an assignment focusing on data collection methods in the school environment. Location Students undertake placements in secondary schools that work in partnership with King’s College London. Partnership schools are located across central London and the Greater London area. Whilst every effort is made to place PGCE trainees in local schools, due to the changing nature of initial teacher education and limited availability of placements in certain subject areas, trainees should be prepared to travel to their placement schools throughout the Greater London area and beyond. Students also organise their own placement at a state primary school. Further information on this short placement is provided during the course.
