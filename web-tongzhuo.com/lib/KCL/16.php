The National College of Teaching and Leadership provides tax free bursaries for teacher training courses. Bursaries range from £4,000-£30,000 depending on the subject area you are training in and your academic qualifications. For information on rates and eligibility please visit  getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/funding-and-salary/overview  or contact the King’s Admissions Office. King’s will automatically assess your eligibility for a bursary when a place on a PGCE course is offered. King’s will apply for the funding on your behalf once the terms of your offer have been met and you have enrolled on the course. Teaching You can typically expect: the equivalent of over 50 days of academic sessions at King’s (typically three hours in the morning and/or afternoon spread throughout the academic year) approximately 120 days of teaching placement.* This includes a short period of placement in primary schools (typically four days) a number of one to one tutorials totaling five to seven sessions across the year two visits from a tutor whilst on placement to observe lessons and monitor progress regular** meetings with a mentor, who will be a member of staff at your placement school, whilst on placement written feedback on all credit-bearing assignments within four weeks of the deadline. *This 120 day figure represents the standard number of placement days. In certain cases, following assessment by course tutors and mentors, students may be required to undertake a greater number of placement days to demonstrate their ability to meet the Teacher Standards. **Typically each trainee will have a meeting with their mentor during each week they are on placement. In certain circumstances the frequency may vary. The types of learning commitment encompassed within the course vary depending on modules. For this course one credit represents the equivalent of 10 hours of learning and engagement. Professional Practice in Education (45-credit module) This module covers the teaching practice that students carry out in secondary schools. As such, much of the time commitment is dedicated to teaching and planning lessons.  Seminars/tutorials: 14 contact hours (seminars/tutorials designed to evaluate teaching performance and provide feedback). Teaching: 200-220 hours of teaching (this includes time teaching by oneself and ‘team teaching’ in groups). Self study/assignment work: 216 hours to include lesson planning, observing lessons, marking pupils work. School Data (15 credit module) Lectures/seminars: 10 contact hours Self-study/ assignment work: 140 hours Studying Policy & Professional Practice (30-credit module) Lectures/seminars: 25.5 contact hours Self-study/assignment work: 274.5 hours of self-study Focused Pedagogical Studies (30-credit module) Lectures/seminars: 200 contact hours. Self-study/assignment work: 100 hours of self-study Assessment The 45-credit honours-level module will be assessed by a combination of a written portfolio (equivalent to 8,000 words) and assessment of your teaching practice against the Teaching Standards as set out by the government’s Department for Education. Progress in meeting the teaching standards will be monitored through three progress reports that will be completed by staff at the placement school. The 30-credit master’s-level modules will each be assessed by a written assignment of 6,000 words heavily based on in-school research that trainees undertakes. The 15-credit honours-level module will be assessed by an assignment focusing on data collection methods in the school environment. The study time and assessment methods detailed above are typical and give you a good indication of what to expect. Location Students undertake placements in secondary schools that work in partnership with King’s College London. Partnership schools are located across central London and the Greater London area. Whilst every effort is made to place PGCE trainees in local schools, due to the changing nature of initial teacher education and limited availability of placements in certain subject areas, trainees should be prepared to travel to their placement schools throughout the Greater London area and beyond. Students also organise their own short placement at a state primary school. Further information on this short placement is provided in the offer holder pack and during the course. Our PGCE English course gives trainees practical and theoretical ideas on the teaching of English as well as modelling ways in which English can be taught in the classroom. Trainees benefit from the college’s unique location on the South Bank and are encouraged to visit the nearby Globe Theatre, Tate Modern and the Saison Poetry Library.

Teaching You can typically expect: The equivalent of over 50 days of academic sessions at King’s (typically three hours in the morning and/or afternoon spread throughout the academic year). Approximately 120 days of teaching placement.* This includes a short period of placement in primary schools (typically four days). A number of one to one tutorials totaling five to seven sessions across the year. Two visits from a tutor whilst on placement to observe lessons and monitor progress Regular** meetings with a mentor, who will be a member of staff at your placement school, whilst on placement. Written feedback on all credit-bearing assignments within four weeks of the deadline. * This 120 day figure represents the standard number of placement days. In certain cases, following assessment by course tutors and mentors, students may be required to undertake a greater number of placement days to demonstrate their ability to meet the Teacher Standards. ** Typically each trainee will have a meeting with their mentor during each week they are on placement. In certain circumstances the frequency may vary. The types of learning commitment encompassed within the course vary depending on modules. For this course one credit represents the equivalent of 10 hours of learning and engagement.   The breakdown below gives you an idea of the likely workload you can expect:  Professional Practice in Education (45-credit module): This module covers the teaching practice that students carry out in secondary schools. As such, much of the time commitment is dedicated to teaching and planning lessons.  Seminars/Tutorials: 14 contact hours (seminars/tutorials designed to evaluate teaching performance and provide feedback). Teaching: 200-220 hours of teaching (this includes time teaching by oneself and ‘team teaching’ in groups). Self study/assignment work: 216 hours to include lesson planning, observing lessons, marking pupils work.   School Data (15-credit module): Lectures/seminars: 10 contact hours. Self-study/assignment work: 140 hours.   Studying Policy & Professional Practice (30-credit module): Lectures/seminars: 25.5 contact hours. Self-study/assignment work: 274.5 hours.   Focused Pedagogical Studies (30-credit module): Lectures/seminars: 200 contact hours. Self-study/assignment work: 100 hours.   Assessment The 45-credit honours-level module will be assessed by a combination of a written portfolio (equivalent to 8,000 words) and assessment of your teaching practice against the Teaching Standards as set out by the government’s Department for Education. Progress in meeting the teaching standards will be monitored through three progress reports that will be completed by staff at the placement school. The 30-credit master’s-level modules will each be assessed by a 6,000 word written assignment heavily based on in-school research that trainees undertake. The 15-credit honours-level module will be assessed by an assignment focusing on data collection methods in the school environment. Location Students undertake placements in secondary schools that work in partnership with King’s College London. Partnership schools are located across central London and the Greater London area. Whilst every effort is made to place PGCE trainees in local schools, due to the changing nature of initial teacher education and limited availability of placements in certain subject areas, trainees should be prepared to travel to their placement schools throughout the Greater London area and beyond. Students also organise their own placement at a state primary school. Further information on this short placement is provided during the course. The PGCE Physics provides a clear, thoughtful and critical introduction to teaching Physics, drawing on leading education research carried out at King’s. We work in close partnership with schools in designing, delivering and assessing our course in order to develop excellent, reflective classroom practitioners. The course information sheet is a printable version of the information on this web page, which you can download  here for PGCE Physics, and  here  for the PGCE Physics: School Direct Route. Courses are divided into modules, and students on this course take modules totalling 120 credits King’s College London reviews the modules offered on a regular basis to provide up-to-date, innovative and relevant programmes of study. Therefore, modules offered may change. We suggest you keep an eye on this course page for updates.  http://www.kcl.ac.uk/sspp/departments/education/study/pgce/pgcefaqs.aspx Applications are made through the central national system for applying for teacher training courses. UCAS-Teacher Training, Rosehill New Barn Lane Cheltenham GL52 3LZ Tel: +44 (0)1242 544788 www.ucas.com   Visit our admissions webpages to view our  English language entry requirements. General entry advice Our PGCE programmes all require a minimum of: Bachelor's degree with at least 2:1 honours (or overseas equivalent) usually in the subject you wish to teach. Knowledge and understanding of the subject you intend to teach. GCSE grade C or above (or an equivalent qualification) in English language and mathematics. Applicants without these English or mathematics qualifications at the time they apply may be considered, but they must obtain them, or pass an equivalent test set by King's, before the course starts. For further guidance see our Physics  FAQs Key Benefits: Our physics course, judged Outstanding by Ofsted, is taught by one of the strongest teams of science education tutors in the country. One reason that the PGCE was judged Outstanding is the strong research base which informs the course. In the last research assessment exercise, the department was rated as one of the top three in the UK. We work in partnership with a wide range of schools in London and beyond, providing a unique opportunity to learn how to teach the full diversity of students. We prepare students to teach outside the classroom: there is a residential field-trip and several other opportunities to make best use of what London has to offer the science teacher, from the South Bank to the Natural History Museum. During the year you will spend over 50 days at university and 120 days in schools. You will work with other trainees and tutors in your subject area to consider the principles and practice of teaching your subject including curriculum design, the development of materials, classroom management and lesson planning. You will also work with trainees from other subjects in a programme of lectures and seminar groups to examine a broad range of educational issues. During both secondary school placements there are occasional days in college for tutorials to support and monitor progress towards the standards for Qualified Teacher Status (QTS). There are crosscurricular research tasks and assignments. There are two blocks of school experience, one starting in the autumn and the other in the spring. You will spend time observing other teachers and their classes before beginning to teach yourself. You will teach more during the second school experience than you will in the first one. During the year you will also complete a short placement in a primary school so that you can see what pupils experience before they arrive in secondary school. The course includes residential fieldwork based at the Field Studies Council centre in Surrey. There are many other opportunities for you to develop your abilities to teach beyond the classroom, in the school grounds and beyond.

Key benefits The Department of War Studies is unique in the UK and one of very few university departments in the world devoted exclusively to the study of war as a human phenomenon. The Department has an excellent reputation as a graduate training institution and is recognised as such by the British Academy, the Arts and Humanities Research Council and the Economic and Social Research Council. Taught by leading experts who bring an extensive and continually growing network of links with other departments, think-tanks, organisations, policymaking bodies and institutions. Our location in the heart of London beside the River Thames brings outstanding advantages. Our course incorporates history, thematic analysis and case studies and is taught by a cross-section of academics from War Studies and the King’s India Institute to give you a broad range of perspectives and experience. It also draws on policy leaders, military professionals and experts in the private sector involved in ‘security management’ to examine practical challenges. We aim to provide you with an understanding of the interrelationships between the history, theory and contemporary practice of security-led issues in South Asia (including Afghanistan) since 1947. https://www.kcl.ac.uk/study/postgraduate/apply/enquiry-form.aspx ","type":"PGT"},"entryTitle":"South Asia & Global Security","sys":{"id":"006cfd41-0000-0000-0000-000000000000","uri":"/api/delivery/projects/website/entries/006cfd41-0000-0000-0000-000000000000","projectId":"website","contentTypeId":"courses","dataFormat":"entry","language":"en-GB","metadata":{},"properties":{},"version":{"createdBy":"SearchDataImport","created":"2018-01-26T18:03:20.8726979Z","modifiedBy":"SearchDataImport","modified":"2018-01-26T18:03:20.8726979Z","publishedBy":"SearchDataImport","published":"2018-01-26T18:03:21.7787472Z","versionNo":"1.0"},"owner":"SearchDataImport"}},{"title":"Film Studies (Film & Philosophy pathway available)","description":"<p>Contemporary film studies is a diverse, interdisciplinary field that incorporates a variety of approaches to the analysis of film and film culture.

Typically, one credit equates to 10 hours of work. Assessment  The 30 credit taught modules are normally assessed by a 6,000 word assignment. However, assessment methods may vary, depending on the optional modules you select, and for the compulsory module you will be required to complete a 5,000 word essay and 1,000 word blog or policy briefing. The 60-credit dissertation is assessed by an extended piece of writing of 16,000 words. You are permitted to take up to 40 of your optional credits from outside of the course, at the discretion of the Programme Director. The contact time and assessment methods for those modules may vary. The study time and assessment methods detailed above are typical and give you a good indication of what to expect.
