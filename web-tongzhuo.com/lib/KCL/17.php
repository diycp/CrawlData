Students are taught by world leading experts and receive training across multiple research fields: molecular &amp; behavioural and psychiatric genetics, twin modelling, statistical genetics, epigenetics, bioinformatics, social and cognitive psychology and developmental psychiatry. Topics are taught from an introductory to advance level through both theoretical and hands-on practical sessions (wet and computer labs), followed by a supervised research project in an area of the student's interest. Students come from a range of academic backgrounds (e.g. genetics, psychology, maths, computing, medicine) and on completion of the course will be exceptionally well equipped to pursue a PhD or work for a pharmaceutical or healthcare organisation. More than half of the students secure PhD studentships while completing the MSc.</p>\r\n<p>In addition to disorder characterisation and&nbsp;presentation of the genetic, social and otherenvironmental risk factors, our course also covers&nbsp;the molecular mechanisms and the specialised&nbsp;analysis methods relevant to interdisciplinary&nbsp;research in this field.
