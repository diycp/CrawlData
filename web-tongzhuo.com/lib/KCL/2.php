The ability to identify and propose a viable research project is a major indicator of your potential for doctoral study. This proposal should be a document of no more than 4 pages in which you explain in some detail precisely the field of study that you want to contribute to and current research gaps, what you want to do and how you propose to do it.  A good research proposal typically includes the following components:  a clear statement of the proposed research question an explanation of the importance and originality of the proposed topic. This may include a section on the lack or shortcomings of existing academic work in your proposed area a section describing not only your proposed methodology but also an explanation of why this methodology is the most appropriate for the proposed topic  a prospective chapter outline of the proposed thesis a timetable showing a realistic plan, including critical milestones, for the completion of your research and writing within three years a concluding section showing why this research should be conducted specifically here, within the CMCI programme at King’s College London, rather than anywhere else. CV In addition to the research proposal, you should include a full curriculum vitae (CV) which will help us to get a far more detailed view of you and your accomplishments than the official form alone permits.  No information required. The deadlines for applications are detailed below. Once the final deadline passes for a start month in 2018, we will open the applications for the corresponding month in 2019. Please note that funding deadlines may be earlier.   April 2018 entry – Application deadline: 18 th February 2018 for Overseas/Home/EU students September 2018 entry – Application deadline: 27 th July 2018 for Overseas students and 31 st August for Home/EU students January 2019 entry – Application deadline: 26 th October 2018 for Overseas students and 3 rd December 2018 for Home/EU students April 2019 entry – Application deadline: 15 th February 2019 for Overseas/Home/EU students Our joint PhD programme with the Humboldt University Berlin offers students the opportunity to enjoy full supervision at both institutions. The Joint-PhD also organises international colloquia and workshops at which students can present and discuss their work with peers and academic staff across the institutions involved. The programme builds on an extensive network of existing institutional links, joint teaching experience and collaborative graduate programmes between King’s and the partners universities. Applications are welcome from across a whole range of areas in culture, media and creative industries with a substantial German element. http://www.kcl.ac.uk/artshums/depts/cmci/index.aspx Visit our admissions webpages to view our  English language entry requirements. Applicants will normally have: a strong undergraduate degree ideally a Bachelors Degee with 1st Class honours (or international equivalent)  A Master's degree with high Merit/Distinction  (or international equivalent), with particularly high results (70% in the UK system)in the dissertation. Application is very competitive for these programmes, so meeting these requirements will not guarantee entry: the research proposal, and the fit with staff expertise, is the critical criterion for our assessment of an application. Applicants with relevant work/life experience who do not strictly meet the academic entry requirements may also be considered. The PhD in Culture, Media & Creative Industries is a programme for those seeking an academic career or who wish to become professionals in the cultural, media or creative sectors. Applicants for the joint PhD programme must contact the relevant departments at both universities before submitting an application in order to discuss the suitability of their topic for the joint programme and to locate potential supervisors. Applications should initially be submitted to the proposed home institution only, ie where the student will start and finish their programme. Students should note that acceptance onto the programme may take slightly longer than for single-institution PhDs because of the additional steps involved. Further details, including FAQs, can be found on the King’s Worldwide web pages . Applicants who choose King’s as their home institution should apply through the online system, selecting the appropriate Joint PhD option from the drop-down list. In addition to the standard supporting documentation, applicants should submit a Travel Plan form indicating how they intend to divide their time between the two partner institutions. Students must spend a specified amount of time in each institution, details of which can be found in the ‘Notes’ section of the Travel Plan form . It is recommended that students submit applications for the Joint PhD programme by the end of March to begin the following September. We encourage you to make early and initial contact with the CMCI PhD Admissions Tutor Dr Roberta Comunian with a full draft application. The CMCI admission tutor will advise whether your research can, in principle, be carried out with us.

These offer you the chance to present and discuss your work at many levels make valuable network connections. The nature of the research in the Department of Chemistry is highly cross-disciplinary and making contacts and exchanging ideas form a core part of this approach to science. Research projects may be co-supervised by staff from different Research Divisions and Departments to support collaboration and application of chemical innovation especially in medicine and biology. Students can expect to pursue an academic career, become health professionals or go into the various industries utilising the chemical sciences (pharmaceutical, energy, materials etc.). Scientific postgraduates are in considerable demand in teaching and the financial sector.

General entry advice The normal entry requirement for the MPhil/PhD programme is: a Master's degree with merit (or international equivalent) and  a 2.1 honours degree at the bachelor's level (or overseas equivalent) It is not essential to have taken courses in this field at postgraduate level but we advise students to consider taking our MA or a similar course elsewhere before undertaking research. Extensive practical experience in a relevant field (diplomatic, journalistic, humanitarian, economic or developmental) may be taken into account when evaluating an application, but a convincing research proposal is essential to being admitted. Every research student is assigned a primary and secondary supervisor. Their progress is monitored through regular meetings of a review panel. European & International Studies mounts regular research seminars and occasional conferences with invited outside speakers. In addition, the European & International Studies Research Students' Workshop allows research students to report on their work in progress and receive feedback from staff members and fellow students.

The Lab aims to understand how stressful experiences in childhood affect development and later health, and how to best support children who had such traumatic experiences. Work in the Lab has the following strategic directions.<br /><br />Consequences of traumatic stress exposure</p>\r\n<p>What are the consequences of traumatic stress exposure in childhood? Child trauma has been associated with a variety of effects on health, wealth, and crime. However, evidence of association does not necessarily imply causation. Establishing causal links between child traumatic stress and later outcomes is challenging because of the likely latency of effects and several potential artefacts (e.g., selection, confounding, and recall biases). Work in the Lab strengthens causal inference through cumulative evidence from longitudinal-prospective studies, meta-analyses, and animal models. This work helps define clear targets for clinical and public health interventions.<br /><br />Biological embedding of stress<br /><br />How is psychosocial stress translated into biological risk for disease? How does early life stress get &ldquo;under the skin&rdquo; and affect health? Work in the Lab tests neurobiological, endocrine and immune pathways that mediate the effects of stress on heath. Furthermore, we are interested in developing and applying innovative analytical methods to study stress biology in young people. Insights into the mechanisms of biological embedding of stress highlight potential targets for secondary prevention and treatment strategies for stress-related conditions.<br /><br />Resilience, reversibility, and treatment<br /><br />How can we help young people who have experienced traumatic stress? Work in the Lab is addressing this question is several ways. We look for modifiable characteristics of the individual that affect resilience or vulnerability to disease in the face of trauma exposure. We ask if currently available treatments modify the biological liability linked to trauma exposure, in order to prevent the onset or the persistence of disease. We explore if it is possible to prevent disease onset or progression by directly targeting the biological liability linked to trauma exposure.<br /><br />Our research builds on collaborations with epidemiological studies, such as the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health &amp; Development Study and the Environmental Risk (E-Risk) Longitudinal Twin Study, and with the National &amp; Specialist Clinic for Child Traumatic Stress and Anxiety Disorders at the Maudsley Hospital.<br /><br /></p>\r\n<p><b>Research projects at the Autism and Related Disorders Lab</b></p>\r\n<p>Autism Spectrum Disorder</p>\r\n<p>We have been studying twins to investigate the role of genetic and non genetic factors and we also collaborate with molecular genetic labs (Sanger Centre &amp; DeCode Genetics) to identify genetic and epigenetic changes linked to ASD.

Gaze contingent computerised animations are used to help develop attention control in babies with a relative (parent or sibling) with ADHD. The study aims to see if the intervention can prevent the development of ADHD later in childhood. Professor Emily Simonoff heads the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry which has a diverse research programme studying both common and rarer, severe disorders that start in childhood often persisting into adulthood. The disorders studied in the Department include: autism spectrum disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, affective disorders, substance misuse, obsessive compulsive disorder, intellectual disability and eating disorder as well as parenting problems and deliberate self-harm. We aim to improve our understanding of how mental disorders develop and establish methods of treatment and prevention. Our research extends into risk factors (both biological and environmental) for the development of disorders and treatment strategies. Members of the Department use a range of scientific methods, including epidemiology, behaviour and molecular genetics, neuroimaging and clinical trials. Research receives substantive funding from external bodies such as the Medical Research Council, Wellcome Trust, National Institute of Health Research as well as smaller charities and other arms of the government. We have an integrated scheme of research, teaching and clinical work. The aim is to understand how disorders develop and to apply the results to make new treatments and assessments, evaluate them and provide need and cost information for health services planners. The links between basic science and translation into improved clinical services are strengthened by the structures of the academic health sciences centre, King’s Health Partners. Many senior academic staff members have particularly strong links with the National Specialist teams based at the Maudsley Hospital. These teams focus on the development of methods and services in specific clinical areas that are integrated with the Department’s research interests. The Department’s teaching is postgraduate and focuses on: The supervision and education of PhD students from a variety of disciplines. An MSc in Child & Adolescent Mental Health for psychiatrists, paediatricians and psychologists with an emphasis on knowledge and skills relevant to countries with developing services. A bi-annual refresher course for consultants. In collaboration with the Children’s Directorate of the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust the Department provides postgraduate clinical training for CT1-3 ‘core trainees’ and ST4-6 ‘specialty registrars’.

Research students in Russian & Eurasian Studies will join a dynamic research culture at King’s, a major research-led university, with a significant number of research students in social science and public policy, as well as in arts and humanities. The Graduate School provides facilities and runs research training courses. Students will receive training through the King’s Interdisciplinary Social Sciences Doctoral Training Centre (KISS DTC), in a programme designed individually to support their research projects and impart broad methodological competencies, alongside their colleagues from other departments and the other Global Institutes. The Russia Institute will run its own research seminars focusing on relevant current research at King’s and elsewhere, and students will have access to concurrent seminars at other departments and institutes.

Visit our admissions webpages to view our  English language entry requirements. We usually require a  minimum 2:1 undergraduate degree, a Masters degree with at least a high Merit (or overseas equivalents) in a subject appropriate to the research area.  Applicants should provide evidence of capacity to work at distinction level, and a piece of independently produced academic work (e.g. a Master’s essay/dissertation or published or unpublished paper) that has been assessed by the supervisor and admissions tutor as showing potential for doctoral level work.  An approved professional qualification and extensive practical experience in the relevant field may be taken into account when evaluating an application.  Those applying for the joint degree are encouraged to contact an academic at King's to develop research links with the partner institution. The Centre for Language, Discourse & Communication offers a supportive, lively and cutting-edge research environment that will compliment the support MPhil/PhD students receive from their departments and their partner organisation. All students are allocated two supervisors, who will work with you through your studies. Applicants for the Joint PhD programme must contact the relevant departments at both universities before submitting an application in order to discuss the suitability of their topic for the joint programme and to locate potential supervisors. Applications should initially be submitted to the proposed home institution only, ie where the student will start and finish their programme. Students should note that acceptance onto the programme may take slightly longer than for single-institution PhDs because of the additional steps involved. Further details, including FAQs, can be found on the King’s Worldwide web pages . Applicants who choose King’s as their home institution should apply through the online system, selecting the appropriate Joint PhD option from the drop-down list. In addition to the standard supporting documentation, applicants should submit a Travel Plan form indicating how they intend to divide their time between the two partner institutions. Students must spend a specified amount of time in each institution, details of which can be found in the ‘Notes’ section of the Travel Plan form . It is recommended that students submit applications for the Joint PhD programme by the end of March to begin the following September.

Applicants for the Joint PhD programme must contact the relevant departments at both universities before submitting an application in order to discuss the suitability of their topic for the joint programme and to locate potential supervisors. Applications should initially be submitted to the proposed home institution only, ie where the student will start and finish their programme. Students should note that acceptance onto the programme may take slightly longer than for single-institution PhDs because of the additional steps involved. Further details, including FAQs, can be found on the King’s Worldwide web pages . Applicants who choose King’s as their home institution should apply through the online system, selecting the appropriate Joint PhD option from the drop-down list. In addition to the standard supporting documentation, applicants should submit a Travel Plan form indicating how they intend to divide their time between the two partner institutions. Students must spend a specified amount of time in each institution, details of which can be found in the ‘Notes’ section of the Travel Plan form . It is recommended that students submit applications for the Joint PhD programme by the end of March to begin the following September.

You should hold or expect to gain a Bachelor's degree (or international equivalent) with first class honours in a relevant discipline including mathematics, physics, chemistry, engineering, materials science, biophysics, geophysical sciences and computer science. Note: A 2:1 (upper second class) honours degree (or international equivalent) may be acceptable depending on the candidate's academic background, including e.g. strong performance (predicted or achieved) in a Master's degree, or mitigating personal circumstances. A strong background in quantitative science will be essential for students to take full advantage of the CANES training programme. English Language Requirements: To follow this programme successfully, you must have a good command of English and be able to apply this in an academic environment. Therefore, you are usually required to provide certificated proof of your competence in English before starting your studies.  To apply to the CANES programme you will need to meet the minimum English Language requirements for the Faculty of Natural & Mathematical Sciences as specified for each of the English Language Tests. More information are detailed here.   Allocations of CANES students to PhD projects will be made around halfway through the MSc year of the CANES programme, based on students' backgrounds and preferences. At that stage students will be assigned at least two supervisors with whom you will work closely, initially in defining a research programme by working towards a detailed project outline by the end of the MSc year. During the PhD years students will attend research-related training as described above, and will also have the opportunity to take advantage of events offered by the London partners of CANES (Imperial College, University College, Queen Mary College) and other local networks including the Thomas Young Centre.

Joint PhDs available: Exciting opportunities to gain a joint PhD with Hong Kong University The Department has a distinguished history, with the study of Physics at King's College dating back to its foundation in 1829. The first Professor was Sir Charles Wheatstone, with other former professors including James Clerk Maxwell, who discovered the unified equations of electromagnetism while at King's, and four Nobel laureates. The seminal x-ray crystallography work by Wilkins and Franklin which led to the discovery of the structure of DNA, was performed in the Physics Department. The department today has a reputation as a friendly and supportive environment, with research in the department encompassing biophysics, materials science, nanotechnology, and theoretical particle physics and cosmology.

We have internationally recognised research strengths in the following areas: European cinema, American cinema (mainstream and avant-garde), world cinema (especially East Asian), cultural approaches, and film theory.  Staff publications and research encompass national cinemas together with popular European genres and stars, art cinema, documentary, and experimental film. Cultural approaches extend to a wider range of cinemas (American and Asian as well as European) and include national and transnational identity in film, gender and ethnicity, the representation of the city, music and film, and new media. Work in the area of film theory addresses the relationships among film and other disciplines such as philosophy, psychoanalysis, literature, geography, and art. In recent years, a number of students at King’s Film Studies have taken advantage of this strategic relationship to conduct comparative research in queer cinema and media, supervised jointly by faculty members from both universities. Students and scholars in both institutions also host events to discuss their current research and ideas. The diverse interests in both groups also allow their members to explore areas and issues beyond each programme’s individual capacity, including South Asian cinemas, Eastern European cinemas, Arabic cinemas and African cinemas. Besides such an ever-expanding global dimension, the two departments are also deeply engaged in cinema’s relationship with spatiality and temporality, especially in cosmopolitan cityscapes like Hong Kong and London. Further collaboration The two departments are developing further collaborative projects in the exploration of comparative histories in film theories, global perspectives in film historiographies and philosophies. In the near future, the two departments will forge new opportunities to host joint conferences, film programmes, festivals and other cultural events. With King’s Film Studies connections to the Cultural Institute at King’s, King’s Global Institutes, Lau China Institute, its current collaborations with the British Film Institute and the Chinese Visual Festival, and with Hong Kong’s networks of cultural institutions including the Hong Kong Arts Centre, the Hong Kong Film Archive and the Hong Kong Film Festival, the two departments wish to continue to expand and deepen our connections both in Europe and East Asia.

If this is the case, you should send a research project outline of approximately 1,500 words with your graduate application form. Your proposal should include the following sub-headings: Research Aims and Questions, Literature Review, Methodology, Provisional Chapter Outlines and Bibliography. We also ask for a sample of written work in the 4,000 word range. Admission will initially be for the MPhil but it is expected that students will transfer to the PhD after an appropriate period, by agreement with their supervisors and the Departmental Postgraduate and Research Committee. No information required. The deadlines for applications are detailed below. Once the final deadline passes for a start month in 2018, we will open the applications for the corresponding month in 2019. Please note that funding deadlines may be earlier.   April 2018 entry – Application deadline: 18 th February 2018 for Overseas/Home/EU students September 2018 entry – Application deadline: 27 th July 2018 for Overseas students and 31 st August for Home/EU students January 2019 entry – Application deadline: 26 th October 2018 for Overseas students and 3 rd December 2018 for Home/EU students April 2019 entry – Application deadline: 15 th February 2019 for Overseas/Home/EU students With growing interests in global, inter-regional and cross-cultural exchanges in the study of film theories and histories, postcolonial discourses, gender and sexualities, race, ethnicities and other forms of sociopolitical identities, as well as interdisciplinary approaches to contemporary media, the Department sees a close affinity with the research interests and directions of Hong Kong University’s Comparative Literature Department. HKU Comp Lit is a world-renowned programme with a strong emphasis in the comparative studies of literature, film and media. It is also considered the hub of East Asian colonial and postcolonial studies and cultural theories, which bring together an interdisciplinary dialogue and cutting-edge debate that reposition Euro-American critical scholarship, generate new ideas specific to East Asia, and reconfigure the existing discourses in Europe and North America. FAQs about joint PhDs can be found on the  King's Worldwide web pages.   The department's training programme covers methods and issues in presentation, illustration and referencing both written or oral communication in film studies, as well as support for formulating topics, reviewing the field and preparing for vivas and conferences. You will have access to the lectures, seminars and special events held under the auspices of the University of London Screen Studies Group. Visit our admissions webpages to view our  English language entry requirements. General entry advice Minimum requirements: Bachelor's degree with 2:1 honours (or overseas equivalent) and Master's Degree with  Merit  (or overseas equivalent), with minimum 10,000 word M.A. dissertation involving substantial historical and/or theoretical research. A degree in film studies, or a subject in which film or media plays a significant part, is an advantage, although candidates from other disciplines and those returning to study will be considered on their own merits.  Applicants with an MFA may be considered, although a substantial writing sample will still be required. The College has made a major commitment to refurbishing its multimedia infrastructure for the study of film and related media. This includes building a significant collection of print and DVD/VHS materials, new facilities for group teaching in 35mm, video, and DVD modes on the Strand Campus, and substantial new information technology resources. We expect our PhD-awarded graduates will pursue academic careers in film and visual studies, as many have; others may develop their skills in careers in the media arts and related activities. Applicants for the Joint PhD programme must contact the relevant departments at both universities before submitting an application in order to discuss the suitability of their topic for the joint programme and to locate potential supervisors. Applications should initially be submitted to the proposed home institution only, ie where the student will start and finish their programme. Students should note that acceptance onto the programme may take slightly longer than for single-institution PhDs because of the additional steps involved.

Applicants who choose King’s as their home institution should apply through the online system, selecting the appropriate Joint PhD option from the drop-down list. In addition to the standard supporting documentation, applicants should submit a Travel Plan form indicating how they intend to divide their time between the two partner institutions. Students must spend a specified amount of time in each institution, details of which can be found in the ‘Notes’ section of the  Travel Plan form . It is recommended that students submit applications for the Joint PhD programme by the end of March to begin the following September.

Visit our admissions webpages to view our  English language entry requirements. General entry advice Minimum 2:1 honours degree (or the overseas equivalent) is required in medicine, immunology, molecular biology, biochemistry, microbiology, genetics, physiology or pharmacology.  A 2:2 degree may be considered only where applicants also offer a Master's degree with merit or above. For further information please contact the Admissions Office Postgraduate (Health) team. NON ACADEMIC REQUIREMENTS Enhanced criminal conviction check Please note that research programmes within the School of Medicine may sometimes require a criminal conviction check depending on the particular topic/method of research. Students each work on individual projects, within established teams of researchers, supervised by the principal investigator of the group and with laboratory supervision on a day-to-day basis. Students are expected to submit their thesis within four years of the start of their studies and to achieve this will need to work at least 09.00-17.00 on a daily basis. Graduate research students work alongside basic science and clinical researchers of all levels and training backgrounds. Projects span basic and clinical science topics allied to respiratory diseases including asthma, rhinitis and chronic obstructive airways disease and are offered at Guy's Hospital, St Thomas' Hospital and Denmark Hill campuses. The division is also part of the MRC and Asthma UK Centre in Allergic Mechanisms of Asthma (in conjunction with Imperial College), so students can benefit from the synergy created by the collaboration in this area of science between two outstanding Colleges in London. The Centre is the only MRC Centre in Asthma and Allergy in the UK. All students have two supervisors and a Higher Degree Co-ordinator. Registration is for MPhil initially and upgrade to PhD occurs at nine months following completion of an 8,000-word report, oral presentation and viva-voce. We run an active programme of external seminar speakers and technology-orientated weekly journal clubs to supplement the core training provided by PhD projects and the generic/transferable skills from the Graduate School. Students also regularly present their goals and findings to a broad interdepartmental audience at research-inprogress meetings as well as externally at national and international meetings. More than 50% of AALB non-clinical PhD graduates continue in post-doctoral positions in either UK or overseas institutions, (eg University of Basel; University of Manitoba; Benaroya Research Institute; Imperial College); most of the remainder gained employment within scientific industries. Seventy five per cent of clinical postgraduate trainees have become NHS consultants in teaching hospitals with a research interest or continued in academic medicine (four are professors at universities overseas).

Visit our admissions webpages to view our  English language entry requirements. Applicants will normally have Masters degree with at least a Merit (or international equivalent) including a dissertation mark of no less than 65% (UK marking scheme) The supervisory relationship is central to the development of the student's knowledge base in relation to his or her research topic. Admission to the public policy programme is highly selective and is dependent upon a good match being found between student interests and supervisor capabilities. Each student is allocated a principal supervisor from within the Department of Political Economy. He or she will be qualified and experienced in the relevant research area and responsible for all aspects of supervision, to include giving advice about the nature of research, the level of standards expected, literature and sources, and attendance at taught classes. Each student is allocated a second supervisor who may be a member of the Department, but could be subject specialist drawn from another department within the School of Social Science and Public Policy. Research students have access to a series of graduate seminars and taught programmes in public policy. The Department of Political Economy enjoys close links with a range of think tanks and public bodies where research collaborations may be possible. Students are expected to progress into academic employment or careers in the world of public policy in a governmental or NGO setting.
