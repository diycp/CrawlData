They all have an extensive research portfolios and an established record for obtaining funding and publishing research in high impact journals. The department has a well-developed framework for helping research students to:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>find the most suitable supervisors</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>to integrate into research groups</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>to develop their projects</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>to monitor their progress</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>to obtain specialist help e.g. with data analysis</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>to obtain pastoral care e.g. to present their data at meetings</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>to provide guidance with thesis and viva preparation.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>All of the research groups work closely with service users, their families, and healthy volunteers i.e in relation to clinical projects. The research groups are:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Affective Disorders</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Diabetes and Psychiatry</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Eating Disorders</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>General Hospital Psychiatry</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>King's Centre for Military Health Research</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Mental Health, Ethics and Law</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Stress, Psychiatry and Immunology Laboratory &amp; Section of Perinatal Psychiatry</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Trauma Studies</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Research students may conduct their postgraduate studies within one of these groups or their project may go across two groups. In some cases, it could involve research with a group elsewhere in King's, for instance, in the Centre for Neuroimaging Studies. In fact, if regulatory conditions are met, the project could involve a collaboration with a group in another university or country.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Clinical Academic Groups (CAG)</strong></p>\r\n<p>To facilitate and to fund clinical academic research, Kings Health Partners has a number of clinical academic groups. Psychological Medicine as a Department is part of the Clinical Academic Group (CAG) with the same name. This CAG within King&rsquo;s Health Partners seeks to cross the divide between psychiatry and medicine.</p>\r\n<p>The principal research methodologies used within the department are clinical, psychological, biological (including genetics and neuroimaging) and epidemiological. These approaches include cross sectional studies, cohort studies and randomised controlled trials (RCTs).</p>\r\n<p><strong>Teaching in the Department of Psychological Medicine</strong></p>\r\n<p>In addition to research and clinical work, the department is very involved in teaching. This occurs across a wide range of programmes and specialist subject areas and in many cases is done via formal lectures.</p>\r\n<p>Teaching in the department also includes structured events such as research student &ldquo;showcases&rdquo; (presentation of work to peers and to staff) and also debates: this means that research students develop presentation skills and become able to assess and discuss data and conclusions.&nbsp; These transferable skills are very important for student development both in terms of becoming &ldquo;part of the dialogue of their subject area&rdquo; but also as a preparation for life after their PhD.</p>\r\n<p>In addition to the research associated issues described above, the teaching environment in the Department means that research students can have the opportunity to become informed on a very wide area of specialist theoretical and practical topics. For example, the Department is involved in the teaching of full time and part time Master's programmes such as the <em><a title=\"Mental Health Studies\" href=\"/study/postgraduate/taught-courses/mental-health-studies-msc.aspx\" class=\"sys_0 sys_t0\" onclick=\"void(window.open('/study/postgraduate/taught-courses/mental-health-studies-msc.aspx','','toolbar=yes,menubar=yes,location=yes,scrollbars=yes,status=yes,resizable=yes'));return false;\" onkeypress=\"void(window.open('/study/postgraduate/taught-courses/mental-health-studies-msc.aspx','','toolbar=yes,menubar=yes,location=yes,scrollbars=yes,status=yes,resizable=yes'));return false;\">MSc in Mental Health Studies</a></em> or the <em><a title=\"War &amp; Psychiatry\" href=\"/study/postgraduate/taught-courses/war-and-psychiatry-msc.aspx\" class=\"sys_0 sys_t0\" onclick=\"void(window.open('/study/postgraduate/taught-courses/war-and-psychiatry-msc.aspx','','toolbar=yes,menubar=yes,location=yes,scrollbars=yes,status=yes,resizable=yes'));return false;\" onkeypress=\"void(window.open('/study/postgraduate/taught-courses/war-and-psychiatry-msc.aspx','','toolbar=yes,menubar=yes,location=yes,scrollbars=yes,status=yes,resizable=yes'));return false;\">MSc in War &amp; Psychiatry</a>.&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n<p>The department also hosts The Maudsley Forum, an international annual four day conference, for psychiatrists, psychologists and others interested in mental health: this gives participants the opportunity to learn about the most current advances in clinical and academic psychiatry. In addition, the department runs a series of e-interactive, popular debates on mental health issues: these attract well known speakers and are attended by service users, carers, professionals, journalists and members of the public.</p>\r\n<p>Research students have access to an extensive programme of teaching related to issues such as ethics, statistics, research project design etc., and in fact, are required to attend a number of these as part of their training.&nbsp;</p>","summary":"MPhil/PhD from the Department of Psychological Medicine at King's College London.","courseLevel":[{"key":"0/5076/5086/5089","name":"Postgraduate research","path":"Root/Courses/Level/Postgraduate research","hasChildren":false,"children":[]}],"level":"PGR","studyMode1":[{"key":"0/5076/5077/5078","name":"Full Time","path":"Root/Courses/Study Mode/Full Time","hasChildren":false,"children":[]},{"key":"0/5076/5077/5079","name":"Part Time","path":"Root/Courses/Study Mode/Part Time","hasChildren":false,"children":[]}],"mode":[{"key":"0/1/2450/2472/2713","name":"Full-time","path":"Root/StructuredContent/CourseData/PGR_StudyMode/Full-time","hasChildren":false,"children":[]},{"key":"0/1/2450/2472/2712","name":"Part-time","path":"Root/StructuredContent/CourseData/PGR_StudyMode/Part-time","hasChildren":false,"children":[]}],"courseDelivery":{"key":"0/5076/5083/5084","name":"Classroom","path":"Root/Courses/Delivery/Classroom","hasChildren":false,"children":[]},"delivery":"Classroom","qualifications":"MPhil/PhD","thumbnail":null,"overview":"<p>The Department of Psychological Medicine at King's College London is the largest department in the Institute of Psychiatry Psychology &amp; Neuroscience (IoPPN).

High Procedure Volume Is Strongly Associated With Improved Survival After Lung Cancer Surgery. JCO. JCO.2013.49.0219; published online on July 29, 2013; The Division of Cancer Studies has a multidisciplinary research portfolio that maps onto and spans the entire patient journey. We bring together and are underpinned by core strengths in haematology, haemato-oncology, breast cancer biology, epidemiology, cancer cell biology, gastro-intestinal cancer and oncopolicy.  We are fortunate to have access to unique resources such as our Bio-Bank. The strategic objective of the Division is to foster a culture of innovation in patient care through research excellence. To achieve this we are working towards fully integrated research pathways, breaking down traditional clinical/academic boundaries and drawing together members of the Division and colleagues from our associated Hospital Trusts. This is reflected in the coordinated strategic planning that has laid the foundations for our Integrated Cancer Centre. There are six Research Sections within the Division: Cancer Epidemiology and Population Health Cell Biology and Imaging GI Cancer Haemato-oncology Molecular Haematology Research Oncology UK/EU Tuition Fees 2017/18 Full time tuition fees: £4,800 per year (MPhil/PhD) £4,800 per year (MPhil/PhD Clinical) Part time tuition fees:  £2,400 per year (MPhil/PhD) £2,400 per year (MPhil/PhD Clinical) £2,400 per year (MDRes) UK/EU Tuition Fees 2018/19 Full time tuition fees: £5,000 per year (MPhil/PhD) £5,000 per year (MPhil/PhD Clinical) Part time tuition fees:  £2,500 per year (MPhil/PhD) £2,500 per year (MPhil/PhD Clinical) £2,500 per year (MDRes) Current regulations allow some students to pay UK tuition fees on the basis of their EU citizenship or residency. Until these eligibility criteria are changed, the EU tuition fee will remain the same as the UK tuition fee. These tuition fees may be subject to additional increases in subsequent years of study, in line with King’s terms and conditions.   International Tuition Fees 2017/18 Full time tuition fees: £21,000 (MPhil/PhD) Part time tuition fees:  £10,500 per year (MPhil/PhD)   International Tuition Fees 2018/19 Full time tuition fees: £22,050 (MPhil/PhD) £42,000 (MPhil/PhD Clinical) Part time tuition fees:  £11,025 per year (MPhil/PhD) £21,000 per year (MPhil/PhD Clinical) £21,000 per year (MDRes) These tuition fees may be subject to additional increases in subsequent years of study, in line with King’s terms and conditions. Studentships may be advertised in publications such as  findaphd.com . They are also posted on the College’s  Health Schools Studentships website .

Please provide information on the research project you wish to undertake, your motivation to undertake postgraduate research and information about your research experience. If you are applying for a specific named project/studentship please include the reference number and project title. Self-funded applicants (through an awarded scholarship or private means) should provide details of how they will fund their studies and state the supervisor(s) to whom they wish to apply. As such it is advised that self-funded applicants contact the Division and/or Research Section that they wish to apply to before making a formal application online. The deadlines for applications are detailed below. Once the final deadline passes for a start month in 2018, we will open the applications for the corresponding month in 2019. Please note that funding deadlines may be earlier.   April 2018 entry – Application deadline: 18 th February 2018 for Overseas/Home/EU students July 2018 entry – Application deadline: 20 th May 2018 for Overseas/Home/EU students Sept 2018 entry – Application deadline: 27 th July 2018 for Overseas students and 31 st August for Home/EU students January 2019 entry – Application deadline: 26 th October 2018 for Overseas students and 3 rd December 2018 for Home/EU students April 2019 entry – Application deadline: 15 th February 2019 for Overseas/Home/EU students July 2019 entry - Application deadline: 17 th May 2019 for Overseas/Home/EU students Centrally coordinated training in transferable skills is provided by the College. For further information about training and development for researchers please view the Graduate School webpages: http://www.kcl.ac.uk/study/pg/school/index.aspx Visit our admissions webpages to view our  English language entry requirements. General entry advice Bachelor's degree with 2:1 honours degree in a relevant subject (or overseas equivalent). A 2:2 degree may be considered only where applicants also offer a Masters degree with Merit or above.  Applicants are strongly advised to contact potential supervisors prior completing the online application form. NON ACADEMIC REQUIREMENTS Enhanced criminal conviction check Please note that research programmes within the School of Medicine may sometimes require a criminal conviction check depending on the particular topic/method of research. Research Sections within the Division encourage their students to take an active part in their internal seminar programme and students are expected to present at least twice yearly to fellow students and staff. Individual Sections provide specific health and safety, and induction sessions. All graduate students within the Division are also encouraged to attend the wide variety of courses offered by the College. Tailored courses, such as those on thesis writing and citation management, are available. First year students are encouraged, where beneficial, to attend selected undergraduate or MRes/MSc courses pertinent to cancer studies. Graduate student progress is monitored initially at the three-month stage and thereafter at six monthly intervals by both supervisors and an assessor from within the Division. This allows both students and supervisors to air any concerns and also promotes regular contact between those involved. Upgrade from MPhil to PhD status is dependent on successful presentation of progress by the student, and is usually expected to occur within the first year of commencement of full-time PhD study. Over 85 per cent of students under the primary supervision of Divisional staff continued in academic and medical research taking Post-Doctoral or more senior positions. The remaining students have taken commercial positions.

Visit our admissions webpages to view our  English language entry requirements. Master's degree in a relavent subject and/or practical experience in the field of study. The supervisory relationship is central to doctoral studies in the Department. Admission to the doctoral research programme is highly selective and is dependent upon a good match being found between student interests and supervisor capabilities. Each student is allocated a principal supervisor from within the Department, experienced in the relevant research area and responsible for all aspects of supervision. A second supervisor is allocated, who may be a member of the Department, or a specialist from another Department in the School. Research students are integrated within a community of research students, research fellows, visiting researchers and senior visiting academics from across the world, and have access to a range of formal and informal study groups and activities organised by this research community.

Master's Degree with Merit (or international equivalent) in a closely related subject, with minimum of Merit in the dissertation element also. Weekly departmental seminars are held in Modern Greek Studies at which students present their work in progress; though not assessed formally, these seminars require compulsory attendance. Byzantine graduates present their work in intercollegiate meetings at the Institute of Classical Studies, where they also attend a full range of seminars. In addition, the Centre for Hellenic Studies runs weekly seminars on Modern Greek and on Late Antique and Byzantine topics, and several annual lectures in the Byzantine and Modern Greek fields. Other Schools and institutes of the University offer a wealth of seminars in related fields, and we are committed to sharing in the wider intellectual life of the University, and of other major institutions such as the British Museum. We also co-operate closely with Greek cultural organisations based in London such as the Hellenic Foundation for Culture and the Hellenic Centre. Regular research seminars for students of modern Greek linguistics are held as part of the Centre for Language, Discourse & Communication (LDC). LDC conducts research in language, communication, society and education, and there are particular strengths in research on 1) the dynamics of language and literacy within globalisation and intercultural contact, and 2) language, literacy and discourse in everyday interaction, education, literature, popular culture, new and mass media, and in medical and workplace settings. Students who undertake an MPhil, PhD study in linguistics with Dr Alexandra Georgakopoulou in BMGS are automatically affiliated with the Centre.

HSPR aims to: Conduct high quality health service and population research in mental health relevant to policy and practice, nationally and internationally; Enable and promote service user and carer involvement in mental health research; Use a multidisciplinary approach to answer important mental health questions; Provide teaching and training in health service and epidemiological research skills; communicate our research findings widely. There are three Research Centres within the Department: Centre for Innovation and Evaluation in Mental Health Centre for Public Mental Health Centre for the Economics of Mental Health. The research focus of each of the Centres can be found on the relevant pages. Our annual publication Towards Mental Health illustrates some of the research conducted. The Health Service and Population Research Group has been honoured with a Queen’s Anniversary Award. These national honours are awarded every two years to institutions of higher and further education across the UK for work of outstanding excellence. Full details and the submission document can be found here: Queen's Prize We run a range of teaching and training programmes, including short courses, MSc courses, and summer schools.

Purpose To benefit patients, carers and wider society through training clinical psychologists who are skilled in evidence-based psychological assessment and intervention, who produce applied research of the highest quality and impact, and who will become leaders within the NHS. Programme Philosophy & Aims The three year training programme values the reflective scientist-practitioner model as a basis for clinical psychology. There is a strong emphasis on integration of theory, research and practice in all aspects of the programme. The programme is underpinned by a biopsychosocial framework. This framework identifies biology, psychological and social factors that contribute across the lifespan to the development and maintenance of psychological difficulties and mental disorders, or conversely to wellness and resilience. Our understanding of this framework is that it is linked to a continuum view of psychological difficulty. Thus, the programme seeks to understand psychological difficulty from an assumption of commonality of experience and human potential. The programme takes cognitive-behavioural therapy as its main therapeutic modality, reflecting the world-leading expertise within the department and wider Institute, and its evidence base. It also has particular strengths in family therapy, neuropsychology, mindfulness-based interventions, clinical health psychology, and the opportunities for research across the Institute are excellent. A further strength is the cohesive and comprehensive range of both local and national specialist placement opportunities, across three world-renowned NHS Trusts: South London and Maudsley, King’s College Hospital and Guy’s & St Thomas’ – known collectively as King’s Health Partners. A final strength is the vibrant and diverse communities within South East London, and the programme values and positively promotes diversity.

The programme has full accreditation from the British Psychological Society (BPS) and graduates of the programme are able to apply for chartered membership and full membership of the Division of Clinical Psychology. On successful completion of the programme, trainees are awarded a Doctorate in Clinical Psychology (DClinPsy) which confers eligibility to apply for registration with the HCPC as a clinical psychologist in the UK. Trainees are both full-time employees of the National Health Service, and registered students on the Doctorate in Clinical Psychology at King's College London. Trainees on the programme are key stakeholders, helping to shape its development and evolution through participation in training committees and feedback systems. To facilitate good communication and focus on trainee issues, trainees are represented on key programme training committees and hold year group meetings with the programme director and other senior programme staff. As well as enhancing the quality of the programme, these experiences provide opportunities to develop skills in leadership and systemic working. The programme has a number of support systems in place to ensure that trainees are well supported and to create a stimulating and rewarding environment for trainees to develop personally and professionally during their training. Before joining the programme, each new trainee is contacted by their ‘buddy’ - one of the current first year trainees - to facilitate their transition onto the programme. Each trainee is allocated a personal support tutor – a qualified clinical psychologist available for confidential advice and support, who is available to meet at least once per term throughout training. Each trainee is also allocated a clinical tutor who will visit them on placement throughout the three years to maximise continuity, support and development. Each trainee is allocated an appraiser from within the programme team to support progression across all aspects of the programme. Reflective practice groups and case discussions run throughout training, which provide an opportunity for trainees to reflect on training and the impact of clinical work.

More information about the department, eligibility criteria and the application process can be found on  our webpages. A research proposal is not required for your application to this programme. The Clearing House deadline for Home/EU applications is usually the end of November. Please refer to their website for more information. The deadline for international applications is the last day in April for entry in October. Prior to this date all applications will be given equal consideration and considered on their individual merits. After this date applications will be considered subject to the availability of places, thus we encourage you to submit your application as soon as possible. Please note that funding deadlines may be earlier than the maximum application deadline. Visit our admissions webpages to view our  English language entry requirements. General entry advice Academic requirements: Normally, a minimum 2:1 undergraduate degree (or international equivalent) in Psychology, or a different discipline where the candidate has achieved Graduate Basis for Chartered Membership (GBC) with the British Psychological Society via a conversion diploma.  Candidates without the required minimum degree class must provide evidence of a qualification at Doctoral level. All applications are enhanced by evidence of a postgraduate qualification. Clinical work experience: In addition, all applicants are expected to have the equivalent of at least one year of full time relevant clinical experience or employment, either paid or voluntary, before submitting their application. Appropriate experience includes one-to-one work with service users, offering therapy and interventions, working under the supervision of a qualified clinical psychologist and conducting and disseminating research. Please note part time volunteer work during a first degree will be insufficient on its own. Important note: Applications from current undergraduates still completing their undergraduate degree or conversion programme at the time of application cannot be considered. All applicants to the Programme must have Graduate Basis for Chartered Membership (GBC) with the British Psychological Society. See links to English language requirements on the right. The programme is intensive, running for 36 months full-time. The programme has academic, clinical and research components, and trainees are required to pass in all areas. Most of the academic teaching, research supervision and clinical supervision are carried out either by members of the Department of Psychology or clinical psychologists working within King's Health Partners (South London and Maudsley, King's College Hospital, Guy's and St. Thomas' Hospitals). Specialist contributions to academic teaching are also made by experts from several other departments within the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience and by invited outside speakers. For research interests of departmental and Institute visit the IoPPN webpages. In each year, trainees spend three days per week on supervised clinical practice (Tuesdays to Thursdays) with Mondays and Fridays dedicated to teaching and research. Trainees undertake six 6-month placements. The four ‘core’ areas of the programme are Adult and Child Mental Health (year 1) and Older Adults and Intellectual Disability (year 2); the third year comprises two elective or specialist placements. Attendance at all course components is mandatory, including during the induction period. The length of the programme cannot be reduced through the accreditation of prior learning or experience. All trainees are required to complete the full programme of training in order to qualify. While on the programme, all trainees take annual holiday entitlement within set time periods to fit in with teaching and placements. Academic Curriculum The content of the academic curriculum covers the broad topics of: • Adult mental health (including anxiety, depression & psychosis) • Psychology and psychiatry of childhood and adolescence • Neuropsychological theory and practice • Clinical psychology as applied to intellectual disability • Mental health of older adults • Clinical health psychology • Forensic psychology • Psychological therapy (with strong emphasis on CBT, family therapy and mindfulness-based therapies) • Research methods • Professional, legal and ethical issues • Race, equality and diversity • Leadership The curriculum is delivered through a combination of lectures, seminars, workshops, reflective practice meetings and small group tutorials. This range of approaches is intended to fulfil the different learner needs and offer the trainee opportunities to reflect critically on theoretical issues and their application to their clinical practice and research. Curriculum delivery reflects the sequence of practice placements, to enhance theory-practice links, and builds core competencies in theory, practice and research developmentally across the three years. Practice Placements Trainees undertake six 6-month placements over the three years: Year 1: Adult Mental Health (one placement) and Chjld & Adolescent Mental Health (one placement). Year 2: Mental Health of Older Adults (one placement) and Intellectual Disability (one placement). Trainees have the option to enrol on a placement based in Ireland during this year. Year 3: Elective or specialist placements (two placements) – trainee’s choice with programme approval. Placements take place predominantly within King’s Health Partners but there are a handful of non-NHS placements in the private and third sectors. Placements are allocated on the basis of core competency needs for each year of study, although there may be some flexibility to take account of trainee preferences and to facilitate Service Evaluation Projects in the second year. Research By May of the final year trainees submit a research thesis in two volumes, this is comprised of: • Literature Review (about 10,000 words in publishable format) • Empirical Project (about 10,000 words in publishable format) • Service -Evaluation Project (9,000 words, usually conducted in the first or second year) • Three Clinical Competency Assessments Trainees are encouraged to start work on the research elements early on in the programme and progress is assessed twice a year via the submission of Research Progress Reports. These progress reports allow the programme team to provide advice, feedback and support to trainees to ensure they stay on track. The reports also provide an opportunity for trainees to disclose any problems they are having to the programme team.   Supervision and Assessment Trainees are allocated clinical supervisors while on placement and a clinical tutor who will visit them on placement. The Service Evaluation Project and all Clinical Competences will have a clinical supervisor and trainees choose their own supervisors for the Literature Review and Empirical Project. Qualifying examinations are held in June of the first year to assess academic curriculum and theory-practice links. Practice placements are assessed by clinical supervisors and the research thesis is assessed at a Viva examination by two external examiners in the summer of the third year. The failure of two placements, or of an examination resit or the Viva examination will constitute a programme failure. No lesser exit award is available under the programme. Most of those graduating from this programme go on to work as clinical psychologists in the National Health Service.

A link at the top of this page leads you into the Admissions portal. The ‘Student Funding’ section of the Prospectus will give you information on possible scholarships, including those available from the AHRC via LAHP ( www.lahp.ac.uk ).  Before submitting an application, it is best to make informal email contact with a potential supervisor. Please consult the ‘People’ section of our website for details of staff expertise and publications. Then you can gain some initial feedback on your proposed topic, and see who in the Department might be best placed to supervise your project. Applicants will normally be interviewed by two members of staff, one of whom will be your prospective supervisor.  All successful applicants, in our department as in others, are admitted initially for the MPhil; most of our students reach a standard allowing them to transfer to the PhD in under 12 months (or part time equivalent).  This process is called ‘upgrading’ and involves submission of a dossier followed by an interview/discussion. (Find out more on the ' Research student journey ' here)   In addition to the basic information requested on the application form, including academic qualifications and contact details for two academic referees, you will need to provide: a sample of your written work (in English or French) of no more than 5,000 words in length; a research proposal of up to two sides in length (plus bibliography). We recognise that this will be provisional at this stage – indeed, we expect your project to develop as you study at King's – but nevertheless we want to hear about your topic, your primary materials, and your proposed research questions, including an indication of how your work will be situated in relation to the existing literature. You should try to convey why you want to work on your topic: why it's exciting to you, and why the results of your research will be interesting to other people. a personal statement: you can use this to describe your academic interests and skills (especially those that equip you for your research project), to explain why you wish to study at King's in particular, and to add any additional information that you feel might support your application. The deadlines for applications are detailed below. Once the final deadline passes for a start month in 2018, we will open the applications for the corresponding month in 2019.

Please do not complete an application form until you have spoken with your preferred supervisor and have their support. Work is usually laboratory-based but we also offer data analysis projects. The Division has excellent facilities for molecular biology, cell culture, confocal microscopy, radioisotope, NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, DNA sequencing and oligonucleotide synthesis. Students receive techniques and research methods training from academic and appropriately-trained technical staff. Central facilities available to staff & students within the division include state-of-the-art library and IT facilities, with an extensive collection of books, journals and electronic databases available to all students. Each PhD student is provided with deskspace and computer access. The Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine has strict procedures in place to ensure adherence to good laboratory practice, overseen by the Faculty Safety Manager. In accordance with College policy and procedures, risk assessments are undertaken by the supervisors and the students prior to the commencement of the project. These assessments (and the associated working procedures) are kept under review and modified as necessary. Students are encouraged to attend the Division's seminar programme featuring internationally-renowned academics from UK and overseas institutions, as well as relevant seminars in the other research divisions at King's. The interdisciplinary nature of the division enables postgraduates to benefit not only from the exchange of information that takes place in the regular laboratory meetings (postgraduate students give seminars within these fora) but also from the cross-fertilisation of ideas provided by the five groups. In addition, staff and students within the Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine interact with the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience (IoPPN), Dental Institute and the Florence Nightingale School of Nursing & Midwifery.  Every year, all postgraduate students participate in a one-day research symposium which provides the forum for them to present posters or oral communications. The symposium is attended by staff, students and representatives from Research Councils, charities and industry. Students are also encouraged to present their work at national and international conferences and the Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine has a travel bursary scheme available to support such activity.

Since the establishment of the Cervantes Chair in 1916 and the Camoens Chair in 1919, the College has become a world-leading centre for Spanish and Portuguese studies and the creation of the new Department of Spanish, Portuguese &amp; Latin American Studies continues this tradition of innovation and research strength. The Department offers a wide range of opportunities for specialist and cross-disciplinary supervision, from the medieval period to the present day, in literature, history, cultural studies, film, drama and music. Our commitment to all areas of Spain, Portugal, Brazil, Latin America and Lusophone Africa, combined with the wide-ranging teaching and research interests of the staff, means that we are able to offer an unrivalled variety of supervision topics for postgraduate study.</p>\r\n<p>You can discover more about the research interests of particular members of staff in the Department on their staff profiles.

Spanish was first taught at King’s in 1831, only two years after the College’s foundation, and the teaching of Portuguese in British universities was pioneered by King’s in the 1860s. Since the establishment of the Cervantes Chair in 1916 and the Camoens Chair in 1919, the College has become a world-leading centre for Spanish and Portuguese studies and the creation of the new Department of Spanish, Portuguese & Latin American Studies continues this tradition of innovation and research strength. The Department offers a wide range of opportunities for specialist and cross-disciplinary supervision, from the medieval period to the present day, in literature, history, cultural studies, film, drama and music. Our commitment to all areas of Spain, Portugal, Brazil, Latin America and Lusophone Africa, combined with the wide-ranging teaching and research interests of the staff, means that we are able to offer an unrivalled variety of supervision topics for postgraduate study. You can discover more about the research interests of particular members of staff in the Department on their staff profiles. Dissemination of our research takes a number of forms, which include: enhancing publishing and programming of the arts, shaping critical practice in musical, visual and literary culture, and influencing public policy. Spanish, Portuguese & Latin American Studies has recently attracted major grants both from the Arts & Humanities Research Council and from UK-based charitable foundations like the Leverhulme for collaborative projects and research positions. In 2016 a team of academics led by Professor Catherine Boyle was awarded almost £3 million under the AHRC’s Open World Research Initiative (OWRI) for the Language Acts and Worldmaking project, to lead research that will seek to inform the future of the study and teaching of Modern Languages. You can find out more about the projects taking place in the Department on the Research Portal. Current projects include: “‘Reindigenisation’ in the post-colonial Andes”, “The history of currency in pre-colonial Atlantic Africa”, “The reception in late medieval and early modern Spain of the Jewish historian Flavius Josephus”, “Culture of the Spanish transition to democracy”, “Brazilian song in translation”.

Until these eligibility criteria are changed, the EU tuition fee will remain the same as the UK tuition fee. These tuition fees may be subject to additional increases in subsequent years of study, in line with King’s terms and conditions.

In addition to the information required by the Faculty’s online Admissions application, candidates are required to submit a research proposal. This should include the following: a) the central research question(s) you intend to address; b) a critical assessment of the relevant published scholarship on the research topic and its related field, indicating how you expect your own project to expand, complement or challenge that existing body of scholarship by the discovery of new materials and data or new analytical insights; c) The material scope of the project, i.e. the materials and resources that will be your object of study; d) Methodological tools and approaches to be employed (including any training you may require; you should already have the language proficiency appropriate to your research programme); e) A proposed plan and schedule of work, to show that your project can be completed within three years (four years including writing up) if you are a full-time student, or seven years (eight including writing up) if you are a part-time student. These are now the maximum allowed registration times for MPhil/PhD students. 3) Find a supervisor: Search for academics working in the field you wish to study. There need not be an exact correlation between your proposal and their research interests, after all it should be a 'unique' project, but they should be equipped to advise you on secondary reading and where to find sources if relevant. Contact your supervisor: It is best to contact your proposed supervisor before you apply. You can then discuss your proposal with them, ensuring that they are happy with the topic. They will also at this time be able to give you advice on your Research Proposal - particularly important if you are hoping to apply for funding. 4) Apply: Once you have been in touch with the supervisor and they have, provisionally agreed to your proposal, apply to the college for a place. Candidates seriously being considered for entry onto the MPhil/PhD programme are normally invited for interview by two or members of the Department’s academic staff, normally including the prospective supervisor and the Research Admissions Tutor. The personal statement should include an account of your academic career to date, your reasons for wishing to pursue a graduate research programme and the particular project as proposed. If have any relevant recent examples of substantial research-based writing, eg from a Master's degree, then these can be sent direct to the Research Admissions Tutor of the Department. The deadlines for applications are detailed below. Once the final deadline passes for a start month in 2018, we will open the applications for the corresponding month in 2019. Please note that funding deadlines may be earlier.

Through the London Arts and Humanities Partnership, students at King’s have access to innovative training portfolios (including public engagement and cultural entrepreneurship programmes. The Modern Languages Research Institute runs Saturday day schools in research skills and methods for MA students and MPhil, PhD students studying in language departments in the University of London. The Institute of Latin American Studies organises a graduate research training programme in the first two terms of the academic year, open to all students researching on Latin America in the colleges of the University of London and in other universities. The programme includes an introduction to library resources and use and is particularly concerned with methodology and issues related to fieldwork. Visit our admissions webpages to view our  English language entry requirements. Master's degree (or overseas equivalent) in a relevant subject. In exceptional circumstances, very strong applicants with a Bachelors degree with 1st class or 2:1 honours may be considered without a Master's degree. Research students are assigned to supervisory teams comprising three members of the Department's academic staff and led by the principal supervisor; as well as providing close guidance to the student, this team manages the student's induction, including identifying training needs, and reports regularly to the Department's Postgraduate and Research Committee (PARC). Students are expected to attend and contribute to the Department's research seminar programme. This seminar series provides an intimate but academically rigorous forum in which students can discuss theories, keep abreast of developments in their field of research and network with other students and academics. We also have strong academic links to the Institute of Latin American Studies as well as other institutes with regional specialisms. All of these institutes offer training and research opportunities, including seminars and lectures, in which our students participate strongly. MPhil : This is a supervised research programme, involving the presentation of a thesis, followed by an oral examination. The minimum period of registration is two years, and the thesis shall be either a record of original work or an ordered and critical exposition of existing knowledge. The maximum length is 75,000 words, inclusive of footnotes and appendices, but exclusive of bibliography. PhD  :This is a prolonged research programme, lasting a minimum of three years full time, culminating in the presentation of a thesis, followed by an oral examination. The thesis must form a distinct contribution to the knowledge of the subject and afford evidence of originality, shown either by the discovery of new facts or by the exercise of independent critical power. It must be suitable for publication, either as submitted or in an abridged or modified form. The maximum length is 100,000 words, inclusive of footnotes and appendices, but exclusive of bibliography. Theses are normally required to be submitted in English. Students whose subject involves an element of study of a modern foreign language may exceptionally apply, with the support of the supervisor, to submit their thesis in a language other than English. All such applications must be made at the point of registration, supported by a detailed scholarly justification, and not for reasons of linguistic competence. They will be considered by the Research Degrees Examination Board, and if authorized, an abstract in English of up to 5,000 words must be submitted at the same time as the thesisStudents whose subject involves an element of study of a modern foreign language may exceptionally apply, with the support of the supervisor, to submit their thesis in a language other than English. All such applications must be made at the point of registration, supported by a detailed scholarly justification, and not for reasons of linguistic competence. They will be considered by the Research Degrees Examination Board, and if authorized, an abstract in English of up to 5,000 words must be submitted at the same time as the thesis. Candidates will normally register in the first instance for the MPhil degree. They may transfer to the PhD programme after no less than one year (with retrospective registration) with the consent of their supervisor and after assessment of progress. While many graduates may go on to a university-based academic career, others will pursue careers in fields such as teaching, journalism, the cultural industries, human rights and development, and translation.

Each graduate student is required to present at least twice during their time here, usually during their first & third years. Training is given in the use of PowerPoint and the method and practice of making formal presentations. There is also a wide range of training opportunities through the Graduate School. Visit our admissions webpages to view our  English language entry requirements. Bachelor's degree with 2:1 honours (or overseas equivalent) in a relevant subject. A 2:2 degree may be considered only where applicants also offer a Masters degree with Merit or above.  Applicants are strongly advised to contact potential supervisors prior completing the online application form. Graduates work with a particular research group, under the guidance of a primary supervisor. They also have a second supervisor, who follows the work closely and is involved in upgrades, thesis writing, and scientific mentoring. They meet regularly with their supervisor(s), usually on a weekly basis, and his/her group, and will attend weekly laboratory meetings, where they will be expected to participate and present their work. All students are required to produce six-monthly progress reports, which are submitted to the School's Postgraduate Research Committee. All graduate students are expected to attend the regular laboratory and Divisional meetings and the annual Graduate Research Showcase Event held by the School. The Division holds monthly Polani Seminars with prestigious speakers, and has a weekly seminar programme which alternates between GMM seminars designed to showcase the work of specific research groups, and a Student Seminar programme at which postgraduate students make short presentations on their work. These are intended to develop new collaborations, strengthen selected areas of research (particularly in areas given high priority by the government, research councils, the Wellcome Trust and NHS), implement further translational research between academic and clinical colleagues, and develop facilities for new technologies. In 2015/2016, subject to approval, the Department of Medical and Molecular Genetics will be introducing a one-year taught MSc in Genomic Data Analysis, which is intended to provide biomedical graduate students with the knowledge and skills needed to engage and analyse large 'omic' datasets - in particular those arising from next-generation sequencing. This is a practical, hands-on data analysis course. The emphasis throughout will be on the analysis of real, large-scale genomic data, to answer questions of translational value in medical research. For further information, please contact Dr Michael Weale (Michael.weale@kcl.ac.uk). St John's Institute of Dermatology offers a one-year taught MSc in Clinical Dermatology for medical graduates wishing to specialise in dermatology. For further information please contact Ms Elena de Teran (derm-courses@kcl.ac.uk) in the first instance. Past students have gone on to further careers in medical research, academia and industry, both in this country and abroad.
