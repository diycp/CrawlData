The Division brings together physicists, chemists, biologists, mathematicians, computer scientists and clinicians working in medical imaging and image-guided therapy into five departments: Cardiovascular Imaging, Cancer Imaging, Biomedical Engineering, Imaging Chemistry and Biology, and Perinatal Imaging and Health. We are keen to recruit PhD students from all these disciplines. All imaging modalities are studied including MR, X-ray, CT, ultrasound, PET and SPECT as well as therapeutic nuclear medicine. Ongoing projects range from the development of new imaging agents and technology and computational image analysis and modelling, through to the clinical assessment of new imaging methods. We have a wide range of work from studies of the basic science of imaging to research into specific clinical areas such as cardiology, neuropsychiatry, oncology, radiotherapy and surgery. Our work is carried out in close collaboration with other groups within the Faculty of Life Sciences & Medicine and associated hospitals.

This is an invaluable resource to facilitate rapid induction of graduates with a strong grounding in conventional science subjects into the world of medical imaging. Visit our admissions webpages to view our  English language entry requirements. Bachelor's degree with 2:1 honours (or overseas equivalent) in a relevant subject. A 2:2 degree may be considered only where applicants also offer a Master's degree with Merit or above. The emphasis in the study environment is on interdisciplinarity and translation to the clinic, and students work in an environment in which close interaction with colleagues from other complementary disciplines is the norm. Office space is provided in a semi-open plan environment shared by chemists, physicists, biologists, image processing specialists and medics. Students are part of the Biomedical Forum in which graduate scientists and clinical fellows communicate ideas and results, facilitating mutual understanding of each other's language and ethos, and in turn leading to rapid translation of research to clinical application. In accord with wider Faculty of Life Sciences & Medicine practice, each student has at least two supervisors, strengthening the cross-disciplinary nature of the training. Students have access to excellent laboratory facilities for radiochemistry and radiobiology, PET, SPECT and MR imaging facilities. Students go on to have varied careers in academia, NHS and in industry.

It covers military, naval, diplomatic and imperial history, international relations, defence and regional security policy studies, strategic studies, and the ethics of conflict. This wide range of topics is united by their relation and relevance to contemporary security and defence issues.</p>\r\n<p>Indeed, DSD&rsquo;s unique position, an academic department based at the Defence Academy, heavily influences its research. At the heart of security and defence education in the United Kingdom, it is able to draw on the experiences and knowledge of a not only UK officers, but officers from a wide range of allied nations. The Department&rsquo;s research is therefore able to benefit from and influence defence thinking and policymaking not just in the UK, but also across the world.</p>\r\n<p>Researchers from DSD have played important role in past UK security and defence reviews and continue to influence future reviews. Additionally, DSD staff members are regularly consulted by national and international media on contemporary and past events. Public engagement includes working with a wide range of museums, such as the Imperial War Museum, the National Army Museum, the RAF Museum, and the Royal Navy Museum. DSD researchers have also contributed to national and international events commemorating the 200th anniversary of the Napoleonic Wars and the 100th anniversary of the First World War.</p>\r\n<p>Research from members of staff is published in top-ranked international journals, including International Affairs, War in History, Journal of Strategic Studies, English Historical Review, International History Review, and Survival. Articles by DSD staff members have won Society for Military History Moncado Prizes, and monographs have won prizes from the Royal Historical Society, the US Navy League, and the Roosevelt Institute. Moreover, researchers regularly present at international academic conferences and institutions, such as Yale University, Hong Kong University, and the National University of Singapore, as well as military institutions, such as the US Naval War College, US Naval Academy, and the Japanese National Institute of Defence Studies.</p>\r\n<p>DSD research projects have been funded by the Leverhulme Trust, the British Academy, the Economic &amp; Social Research Council (ESRC), the Arts &amp; Humanities Research Council (AHRC), the MacArthur Foundation, the British Council, the European Commission, the US Army War College, the UK Ministry of Defence, and the US Department of Defense.</p>\r\n<p>Since 2011, we have run our own postgraduate research programme.

More publications Research in the Defence Studies Department (DSD) is reflective of the diverse interests of our staff members and postgraduate students. It covers military, naval, diplomatic and imperial history, international relations, defence and regional security policy studies, strategic studies, and the ethics of conflict. This wide range of topics is united by their relation and relevance to contemporary security and defence issues. Indeed, DSD’s unique position, an academic department based at the Defence Academy, heavily influences its research. At the heart of security and defence education in the United Kingdom, it is able to draw on the experiences and knowledge of a not only UK officers, but officers from a wide range of allied nations. The Department’s research is therefore able to benefit from and influence defence thinking and policymaking not just in the UK, but also across the world. Researchers from DSD have played important role in past UK security and defence reviews and continue to influence future reviews. Additionally, DSD staff members are regularly consulted by national and international media on contemporary and past events. Public engagement includes working with a wide range of museums, such as the Imperial War Museum, the National Army Museum, the RAF Museum, and the Royal Navy Museum. DSD researchers have also contributed to national and international events commemorating the 200th anniversary of the Napoleonic Wars and the 100th anniversary of the First World War. Research from members of staff is published in top-ranked international journals, including International Affairs, War in History, Journal of Strategic Studies, English Historical Review, International History Review, and Survival. Articles by DSD staff members have won Society for Military History Moncado Prizes, and monographs have won prizes from the Royal Historical Society, the US Navy League, and the Roosevelt Institute. Moreover, researchers regularly present at international academic conferences and institutions, such as Yale University, Hong Kong University, and the National University of Singapore, as well as military institutions, such as the US Naval War College, US Naval Academy, and the Japanese National Institute of Defence Studies. DSD research projects have been funded by the Leverhulme Trust, the British Academy, the Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC), the Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC), the MacArthur Foundation, the British Council, the European Commission, the US Army War College, the UK Ministry of Defence, and the US Department of Defense. Since 2011, we have run our own postgraduate research programme. We attract studentships from a variety of sources, including the ESRC and the AHRC, as well as the MacArthur Foundation, the UK Ministry of Defence and the US Department of Defense. We also offer studentships funded directly by the department. All students have access to King’s ESRC Doctoral Training Centre.

Until these eligibility criteria are changed, the EU tuition fee will remain the same as the UK tuition fee. These tuition fees may be subject to additional increases in subsequent years of study, in line with King’s terms and conditions. The normal entry requirement for the MPhil/PhD programme is a master’s degree with a distinction or high merit (or overseas equivalent), and/or a first or 2.1 honours degree at the Bachelors level (or overseas equivalent). It is not essential to have taken courses in this field at postgraduate level, but we advise students to consider taking one of our MA's or a similar course elsewhere before undertaking research work in the Defence Studies Department. Extensive practical experience in the relevant field (e.g. military, diplomatic, journalistic, humanitarian or developmental) may be taken into account when evaluating an application. Applicants will need to find a potential supervisor before applying. Those applying for the joint degree are expected to contact academics at both King's and the partner institution to agree joint supervision. Applications are subject to a formal interview (in person or online). To apply for most of our postgraduate programmes at King's you will need to complete our postgraduate online application form. A minority of programmes have a different application procedure which will be outlined below. Applying online makes applying easier and quicker for you, and means we can receive your application faster and more securely. King's does not normally accept paper copies of the postgraduate application form as applications must be made online. However, if you are unable to access the online postgraduate application form, please contact the relevant admissions/School Office at King's for advice. If you have already applied to King's through our online application form you can check the status of your application by logging into  myApplication . APPLY HERE APPLICATION PROCEDURE If you are interested in pursuing postgraduate research in the Defence Studies Department, you should look at the staff profiles in the ‘DSD People’ section of our website to identify a potential supervisor with research interests in a similar area. Ideally, you should contact them to discuss your proposal before making an official application through the King’s online application system. The following documents should be submitted as part of your on-line application: • A research proposal • Complete academic transcripts • a sample of your previous writing (this would usually be an extended piece of writing such as a dissertation/thesis from masters or undergraduate study, or perhaps a research paper if you have been involved in more recent research and you are the sole author. The writing sample should be in English. • two references. Once all of this material is received, your application will be considered by a panel of academic tutors. Some applicants may be interviewed, either in person, or by telephone/Skype. It is compulsory that all applications include a research proposal. Applications that are received without one will be rejected. The potential student should produce the proposal with the help of their potential supervisor. The proposal should be no longer than 6 pages of A4 and size 12 font. The proposal should include an introduction to the research topic, the research question the student wants to answer, brief details on what methods/theories the research will used to answer the question, and a short literature review. Any application should include: • research proposal (compulsory) • writing sample (compulsory) • supporting documentation (transcripts and references) • English Language Qualification (if English is not your first language) Please also check the details on the Department website . The deadlines for applications are detailed below. Once the final deadline passes for a start month in 2018, we will open the applications for the corresponding month in 2019. Please note that funding deadlines may be earlier.   September 2018 entry – Application deadline: 27 th July 2018 for Overseas students and 31 st August for Home/EU students January 2019 entry – Application deadline: 26 th October 2018 for Overseas students and 3 rd December 2018 for Home/EU students   Students will have their training and development needs assessed and will, with their supervisor, draw up a personalised programme of training that will both allow them to complete their research project and also provide the skills they will need in their subsequent career. This training will include courses provided by the Department, the War Studies Group, the Graduate School or the KISS-DTC, as well as attending, presenting at and helping to organise research workshops and conferences. Visit our admissions webpages to view our  English language entry requirements. Master's degree with high merit (or overseas equivalent), and a 2:1 honours degree at the bachelor's level (or overseas equivalent).  It is highly desirable (but not essential) to have taken courses in this field at postgraduate level before undertaking research work in the Defence Studies Department.  Extensive practical experience in a relevant field (eg military, diplomatic, humanitarian or developmental) may be taken into account when evaluating an application. Postgraduate students are allocated a supervisor from within the Defence Studies Department and a second supervisor either from DSD or another Department. They meet their primary supervisor regularly, with formal progress reviews being held every six months. Students have access to workspaces with computers and printers, either located in the Department of War Studies on the Strand Campus or at the Joint Services Command and Staff College, subject to security clearance. Students can also request access to the library of the JSCSC. Students are encouraged to take part in the lively research culture of the Department and the Group, attending research seminars (at which they are expected at some point to present a paper on their work), student-organised research workshops, or the regular seminars, visiting lectures and conferences that are held either in London or at the JSCSC in Shrivenham. They are also expected to participate in one or more of the DSD or War Studies research groups which organise their own programmes of events. Our graduates pursue careers in academia, think tanks and research institutions, the armed forces, government services, international organisations and the media.

Research in the Department reflects a ‘big tent’ view of the digital humanities, and there are no a priori restrictions on the area of research, assuming that appropriate supervisors can be found, and no fixed expectations of particular technical skills. We welcome applications from potential students with any disciplinary background in the humanities or social sciences. An overview of the areas of research carried out in the department may be found on the departmental website . Profiles and research projects of current MPhil and PhD students may be found in the King’s research portal .   UK/EU Tuition Fees 2017/18 Full time tuition fees: £4,800 per year Part time tuition fees: £2,400 per year   UK/EU Tuition Fees 2018/19 Full time tuition fees: £5,000 per year Part time tuition fees: £2,500 per year Current regulations allow some students to pay UK tuition fees on the basis of their EU citizenship or residency. Until these eligibility criteria are changed, the EU tuition fee will remain the same as the UK tuition fee. These tuition fees may be subject to additional increases in subsequent years of study, in line with King’s terms and conditions.   International Tuition Fees 2018/19 Full time tuition fees:  £17,850 per year               Part time tuition fees: £8,925 per year   International Tuition Fees 2018/19 Full time tuition fees:  £18,740 per year               Part time tuition fees: £9,370 per year These tuition fees may be subject to additional increases in subsequent years of study, in line with King’s terms and conditions. Prior to formal application students develop a cogent research proposal in correspondence with Dr Mark Hedges.  A preliminary visit to the department in London is highly desirable but not required. Normally studies begin in the autumn semester. If advised to proceed, applications should be made by early January, particularly if funding is required. Admission to the PhD programme is initially for the MPhil, but we expect students to transfer to the PhD after an appropriate period, by agreement with their supervisor, the departmental Research Committee and the College. No information required. The deadlines for applications are detailed below. Once the final deadline passes for a start month in 2018, we will open the applications for the corresponding month in 2019. Please note that funding deadlines may be earlier.   April 2018 entry – Application deadline: 18 th February 2018 for Overseas/Home/EU students September 2018 entry – Application deadline: 27 th July 2018 for Overseas students and 31 st August for Home/EU students January 2019 entry – Application deadline: 26 th October 2018 for Overseas students and 3 rd December 2018 for Home/EU students April 2019 entry – Application deadline: 15 th February 2019 for Overseas/Home/EU students A research degree in the digital humanities will equip you to make substantial and original contributions to any field or activity in which digital technologies and methods are applied to the study, conservation or presentation of cultural artefacts, or in which there is a need to manage and analyse complex digital information. Because the degree privileges human knowledge and cultural production, rather than the tools that may be used to study these, it will also prepare you to offer powerfully creative resistance to digital technologies in their present form, and thus to help advance them in positive directions. The degree is thus highly relevant for subsequent work not only in higher education and cultural organisations and industries, but also in any organisation in the public or private sectors in which complex digital information plays a significant role. Research students are expected to spend a week per year on training in transferable and research skills, and will have access to a diverse range of training opportunities. Students can attend a variety of specialist MA modules offered within the Department, on topics such as text technologies, spatial humanities, or metadata. The King's Graduate School runs a Researcher Development Programme of personal, professional and career development activities for all research students, and there is a centrally provided programme of ICT and related skills training. Students are able to take part in a wide portfolio of training courses ranging from generic study and employability skills, language courses at the College's Modern Language Centre, through to specific conceptual and methodological courses offered by the ESRC-funded King’s Interdisciplinary Social Science DTC. King’s is also a partner in the AHRC London Arts and Humanities Partnership (LAHP) collaborative doctoral training partnership (with University College London and the School of Advanced Study, University of London), which supports an extensive network of training courses and events for AHRC-funded students. Our research students are also encouraged to submit papers to conferences, and there are Faculty funding schemes to which students can apply for financial support to allow them to travel and present their papers.   Visit our admissions webpages to view our  English language entry requirements. General entry advice An MA degree in the humanities or social sciences, with a mark of Distinction or high Merit (or  international equivalent). In exceptional circumstances, applicants holding a first class honours degree (or overseas equivalent) may be admitted. Applicants must demonstrate mastery of the academic background deemed relevant to the research proposed. All PhD candidates are allocated two supervisors, and are expected to meet with their primary supervisor on a regular basis, with progress reports submitted every six months. Students will normally be upgraded from MPhil to PhD status after 9-18 months, with a transfer to 'writing up' status usually occurring after three years of full-time study. Upon submission of the thesis, assessment is by means of an oral examination (viva). Our postgraduate students are an integral part of the academic life of the Department. We are a growing department with many internationally recognised researchers and visiting academics. We have a wide range of both national and international projects, collaborations with other departments, as well as with other higher education institutions, cultural and memory organisations, and digital industries. Our students have access to good library facilities, and there is a research student room within the department. The Department has an active PhD seminar series, which provides students with the opportunity to present their research and discuss its progress and its relationship to the broader discipline, and students are also invited to participate in the departmental seminar series. There is an annual PhD student conference, organised by the students themselves, as well as a range of seminars and other events both within King’s and at academic and cultural institutions around London. London offers unparalleled diversity and richness for students in the humanities and cultural heritage, with the largest concentration of memory and cultural institutions in the UK, including the major document repositories at the National Archives, and the extensive digital and physical resources of the British Library. London also possesses extensive media and digital industries, with many opportunities for internships and employment. Research students can apply to become Graduate Teaching Assistants to assist members of staff in delivering modules to undergraduate students on the BA in Digital Culture. Full training is provided to enable students to make the best use of this opportunity for acquiring valuable teaching experience.   A research degree in the digital humanities will equip you to make substantial and original contributions to any field or activity in which digital technologies and methods are applied to the study, conservation or presentation of cultural artefacts, or in which there is a need to manage and analyse complex digital information. Because the degree privileges human knowledge and cultural production, rather than the tools that may be used to study these, it will also prepare you to offer powerfully creative resistance to digital technologies in their present form, and thus to help advance them in positive directions. The degree is thus highly relevant for subsequent work not only in higher education and cultural organisations and industries, but also in any organisation in the public or private sectors in which complex digital information plays a significant role.

A randomised control trial to determine the effectiveness of Assertive Community Treatment for the treatment of alcohol dependence compared with standard treatment and is funded for 3 years by the Department of Health. Partner organisations South London & Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust King’s College Hospital Guy’s and St Thomas’ Hospital The emphasis of our research is on ‘what works’ in the prevention and treatment of substance-related problems: the NAC represents a network of clinicians, researchers and clinical teachers who have a shared commitment to excellence in prevention and treatment work, and to supporting and strengthening national and international endeavours in this field.  Over the last 40 years, the NAC has developed a body of research evidence that has informed the evidence base for theUK treatment system and development of new treatment services for alcohol, smoking and drug problems. This work ranges from trials of new therapies and preventative treatments to studies seeking to understand the genetic and biological basis of addictive behaviour. PhD projects are available in areas related to the development and evaluation of new treatments for alcohol, smoking and drug problems and includes studies seeking to understand the underlying psychological and biological bases and change processes of addictive behaviours, as well as policy-driven and workforce development projects and treatment trials. Professor John Strang who heads the Department is one of theUK’s leading experts in addiction and one of only six Addiction Research scientists outside North America who is listed in www.isihighlycited.com.

Additionally, training for most laboratory techniques is available within the Division. It is expected that graduate students will attend many of these courses to help them rapidly attain the high level of technical and IT expertise required to produce top quality work. Visit our admissions webpages to view our  English language entry requirements. Bachelor's degree with 2:1 honours (or overseas equivalent) in a relevant subject. A 2:2 degree may be considered only where applicants also offer a Master's of Science degree with Merit or above.  Please do not complete an application form until you have spoken with and have confirmation from your preferred supervisor. The Division currently has 45 PhD students each working on individual projects, within established teams of researchers, supervised by the Principal Investigator of the group and commonly interacting with fellow laboratory researchers on a day-today basis. Students are expected to submit their thesis within four years of the start of their studies - to achieve this they will need to work and think carefully and intensively on a daily basis. Departments run laboratory meetings, which students will be required to attend and there is a strong ethos of continued education, so students are encouraged to broaden their scientific knowledge by attending seminars in other departments within the Division. Students are supported throughout their three-year (FT) or six-year (PT) studies by a personal committee composed of the student's two Supervisors, two independent experts and a Chairperson, who is part of the Postgraduate Teaching Committee. The student has regular six-monthly reports/meetings to monitor progress. In addition, they present their work at laboratory and departmental meetings and at the annual divisional Graduate Students' Research Day. Contact Division for details.

Before applying, please read carefully the information about our research interests, and make sure that your research topic falls within one of these areas. You are welcome to contact a potential supervisor directly to discuss your research topic, and we also encourage you to contact the India Institute PhD admissions tutor with a draft research proposal before submitting a complete application through the online system. The admissions tutor will advise whether your research can, in principle, be carried out with us. Admission will initially be for the MPhil but students are expected to transfer to the PhD proper by the end of the first year, and no later than the end of the second year, on the recommendation of the Institute’s graduate upgrading panel. September, January, and April start dates available. Applicants are strongly encouraged to start their degree at beginning of the academic year in September, when the College offers a full induction programme. In addition to a 3-5 page research proposal, applicants should submit a personal statement outlining their reasons for pursuing further research. The deadlines for applications are detailed below. Once the final deadline passes for a start month in 2018, we will open the applications for the corresponding month in 2019. Please note that funding deadlines may be earlier.   September 2018 entry – Application deadline: 27 th July 2018 for Overseas students and 31 st August for Home/EU students January 2019 entry – Application deadline: 26 th October 2018 for Overseas students and 3 rd December 2018 for Home/EU students We offer two dedicated PhD modules viz. Interpreting India and Methods in the Social Sciences and Humanities besides a weekly Writing Up seminar. In addition, students are encouraged to audit relevant MA modules at the India Institute and across College, and can take dedicated doctoral training courses run by the KISS-DTC. We also host a weekly seminar series India@King's. Visit our admissions webpages to view our  English language entry requirements. A Master's degree (or international equivalent) is usually required.  In exceptional circumstances only, a Bachelor's degree with first class or high 2:1 honours (or international equivalent) will be considered.  Applicants to the Joint programme are encouraged to contact an academic at King's to develop research links with the partner institution The India Institute offers a lively and thought-provoking programme of seminars, workshops and colloquia, all of which encourage interaction between graduate students, research staff and a wider audience. Together with the Institute's core staff and associate faculty across various departments at King's, PhD students add to the multi-disciplinary and vibrant intellectual atmosphere of the Institute. The Institute also regularly hosts internationally renowned visiting fellows who add an important dimension to our stimulating academic environment. While many graduates may go on to a university-based academic career, others may pursue careers in both the public and private sector. Applicants for the Joint PhD programme must contact the relevant departments at both universities before submitting an application in order to discuss the suitability of their topic for the joint programme and to locate potential supervisors. Applications should initially be submitted to the proposed home institution only, ie where the student will start and finish their programme. Students should note that acceptance onto the programme may take slightly longer than for single-institution PhDs because of the additional steps involved. Further details, including FAQs, can be found on the King’s Worldwide web pages . Applicants who choose King’s as their home institution should apply through the online system, selecting the appropriate Joint PhD option from the drop-down list. In addition to the standard supporting documentation, applicants should submit a Travel Plan form indicating how they intend to divide their time between the two partner institutions. Students must spend a specified amount of time in each institution, details of which can be found in the ‘Notes’ section of the Travel Plan form .

In accordance with College policy and procedures, risk assessments are undertaken by the supervisors and the students prior to the commencement of the project. These assessments (and the associated working procedures) are kept under review and modified as necessary. Students are encouraged to attend the Institute’s in-house seminar programme featuring internationally-renowned academics from UK and overseas institutions, as well as relevant seminars in the other research divisions at King’s. The interdisciplinary nature of the Institute enables postgraduates to benefit not only from exchange of information that takes place in the regular laboratory meetings (postgraduate students give seminars within these fora) but also from cross-fertilization of ideas provided by the five groups. In addition, staff and students within the Faculty of Life Sciences & Medicine interact with the Dental Institute, the Faculty of Nursing & Midwifery, as well as the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience. Every year, all postgraduate students participate in a one-day research symposium which provides the forum for them to present posters or oral communications. The symposium is attended by staff, students and representatives from Research Councils, charities and industry. Students are also encouraged to present their work at national and international conferences and the Faculty of Life Sciences & Medicine has a travel bursary scheme available to support such activity. Usually students pursue an academic career or go into the pharmaceutical industry.

The Software Modelling & Applied Logic group concentrates on two related research directions:  The formulation and applications of logic and mathematics across the gamut of computer science and software engineering, including quality of service, business computing, service oriented architectures, model driven architecture, security and artificial intelligence. Various models of reasoning and computation, applying them to the design of programming languages, specification languages, theorem provers, information and software security, and software modelling tools. Requests for further information about the group should be directed to the Head of Group, Professor Maribel Fernandez:  Maribel.Fernandez@kcl.ac.uk . Planning The Planning Group consists of 5 academic staff, including 2 professors (Maria Fox and Derek Long) and 3 lecturers (Andrew Coles, Amanda Coles and Daniele Magazzeni), as well as a number of EU and EPSRC-funded research fellows and research students. Planning Research at King's focusses on domain-independent planning. Planning is an active research area within the broader field of Artificial Intelligence, and has strong links with scheduling and optimisation research. The primary problem is the identification of sequences of actions which will achieve specified goals from specified initial conditions. Domain-independent planning is concerned with the fundamental principles of planning, typically concentrating on search techniques, search control methods and the representation and treatment of uncertainty, non-determinism, resources, time and other issues. Planning has been successfully applied to a range of fielded industrial applications and we are actively engaged in applications in energy, aerial surveillance, underwater exploration, space, logistics and home robotics. Requests for further information about the group should be directed to the Head of Group, Professor Maria Fox:  Maria.Fox@kcl.ac.uk .

We encourage you to discuss research possibilities with the department prior to application - please do get in touch with us directly. A focussed research proposal (750 words) must be submitted with your application. You may also be asked to submit samples of your written BA work, relevant projects or MA dissertation. You should expect to be invited to an interview to discuss your research plans with your potential supervisor and another member of the department. Admission to our research programmes will initially be for the MPhil but we expect students to transfer to the PhD after an appropriate period, by agreement with their supervisor and the Departmental Postgraduate Research Committee. Filling out the application forms for PhD courses and funding bodies is a time-consuming - and important – business. It’s important to remember that all postgraduates are interested in their courses and so course selectors and funding bodies are looking for evidence of the following to make their decision: How does the candidate's project build on/follow on from what they've done before? Does the chosen programme of study come across as a logical next step in the context of that individual's personal and academic development? What specific modules/authors/dissertations/essays did the candidate do in the past that made them choose this particular programme of study? Does the candidate have a clear focus? Do they have a clear idea of what their proposed programme of study will give them? What skills can the candidate bring to the programme (eg. languages, analytical skills, professional experience etc.)? Do they have what it takes to complete the programme successfully? Does the candidate have a clear idea about a dissertation topic? Have they got a project that might be classified as 'innovative'? Why are they applying to King’s?

The programme offered provides candidates with the opportunity to divide their PhD study between two prestigious universities (King’s and the University of Hong Kong), enjoying full supervision at both. While supervisions and regular graduate seminars enable students to construct a theoretical, historical and systematic framework for their research, the Joint PhD also organizes international colloquia and workshops at which students can present and discuss their work with peers and academic staff across the institutions involved. The programme builds on an extensive network of existing institutional links, joint teaching experience and collaborative graduate programmes between King’s and our partner universities. Find out more about our strategic partner, University of Hong Kong . Students on the MPhil/PhD programme are immersed in the academic culture and are encouraged to engage in a wide range of learning opportunities. Students will normally undertake two core research methods modules: Advanced quantitative research methods offers an in-depth study of quantitative research methods including epidemiological studies and randomised controlled trials, and Advanced qualitative research methods offers an in-depth study of different qualitative methods and their relationship to epistemological theory. Students can also access doctoral training courses organised by King's Graduate School and the ESRC training centre where places permit, and all students are encouraged to become actively involved in research seminars and fora. Research students are encouraged to present their doctoral research at conferences and a School competition fund exists to support this. Visit our admissions webpages to view our  English language entry requirements. An English Language test must be submitted with the application in order to meet minimum requirements. Applicants should normally hold an upper second class undergraduate degree and a masters degree obtained from a UK university or an overseas qualification of equivalent standard. The Faculty of Nursing & Midwifery offers a supportive and intellectually stimulating environment. In the Postgraduate Research Experience Survey (PRES) 2015, results for the Faculty of Nursing & Midwifery indicated that student experience was positive about all aspects of supervision, skills and development, infrastructure, intellectual climate, and knowledge of roles and responsibilities within the Faculty. Research students are allocated a supervisory team led by an experienced principal supervisor. The team meet regularly with the student for supervision and review of progress. Progress is also reviewed formally by the Faculty Postgraduate Research Students Committee at set points in the academic year. Supervisors provide advice on training needs and career development. Student representatives for full-time and part-time students play an important role in communicating student feedback about learning experiences and the support infrastructure to inform ongoing programme development. Research students have a study suite in the James Clerk Maxwell Building and access to Graduate Lounges on the different campuses. PhD graduates have been successful in obtaining academic, research and clinical posts in universities and healthcare organisations around the world including the UK, Syria, Jordan, Taiwan and Ghana. Applicants to Joint PhD programmes are encouraged to contact the department before submitting an application, to discuss the suitability of their topic for the joint programme and the availability of suitable supervisors at both institutions. Applications should initially be submitted to the proposed home institution only, i.e. the institution where student will start and finish their programme. Applications will then be assessed by both partners. Applicants who choose King’s as their home institution should apply through the online application form, selecting the appropriate Joint PhD option from the drop-down list. In addition to the standard supporting documentation, applicants should submit a travel plan indicating how they intend to split their time between the two partner institutions. Applicants to Joint PhD programmes are normally expected to start the programme in September.

Those intending to apply for research degrees in the department should search the staff pages on the history website to identify a supervisor appropriate to their intended field of study and contact them to discuss their research proposal in detail prior to making an official application. Once they have confirmed with their intended supervisor that the topic is one they would be able to supervise, applicants should apply online. Applications will not be considered until the department has received two references, an official transcript from the candidate's last place of study and a research proposal with the application. All applicants for graduate research will be interviewed and they may be requested to supply some written work on an appropriate subject with their formal application. Admission to our research programmes will initially be for the MPhil but we expect students to transfer to the PhD after an appropriate period, by agreement with their supervisor and the Departmental Postgraduate & Research Committee. No information required. The deadlines for applications are detailed below. Once the final deadline passes for a start month in 2018, we will open the applications for the corresponding month in 2019. Please note that funding deadlines may be earlier.

The King's Graduate School runs a Researcher Development Programme of personal, professional and career development activities for all research students. The postgraduate training programmes at King’s, UCL and SAS are currently being brought together within LAHP, greatly expanding the training opportunities available to all. The Institute of Historical Research (IHR), part of SAS, offers a comprehensive programme of short training courses in research skills for historians, which are complemented by the School of Advanced Study's Research Skills Workshops. Visit our admissions webpages to view our  English language entry requirements. Minimum requirements: Bachelor's degree with 1st class or 2:1 honours degree (or international equivalent) and a Master of Arts with Distinction or Merit (or overseas equivalents) in a related subject. Previous study need not be History but students without History degrees will be expected to show advanced skills of analysis and historical research which their potential supervisor considers necessary. In exceptional cases, particularly strong applicants who do not hold a Distinction or Merit in their Master's degree may be considered.  Those applying for the joint degree are encouraged to contact an academic at King's to develop research links with the partner. All students are allocated two supervisors and are expected to meet with their primary supervisor (or both if jointly supervised) on a regular basis. Shared supervision across the partner institutions in LAHP is encouraged. Monthly supervision reports are filed for all full-time students and supervisors must submit progress reports every six months in consultation with the student. There will be a further review by two members of the department at the end of the student's first and third years. After 9-12 months the student will normally be upgraded from MPhil to PhD status with a transfer to 'writing up' status usually occurring after three years full-time study. Upon submission of the thesis, assessment is by means of an oral examination (viva). Our students go on to careers in academia, teaching, the civil service and the public sector. Applicants for the Joint PhD programme must contact the relevant departments at both universities before submitting an application in order to discuss the suitability of their topic for the joint programme and to locate potential supervisors. Applications should initially be submitted to the proposed home institution only, ie where the student will start and finish their programme. Students should note that acceptance onto the programme may take slightly longer than for single-institution PhDs because of the additional steps involved. Further details, including FAQs, can be found on the King’s Worldwide web pages . Applicants who choose King’s as their home institution should apply through the online system, selecting the appropriate Joint PhD option from the drop-down list. In addition to the standard supporting documentation, applicants should submit a Travel Plan form indicating how they intend to divide their time between the two partner institutions. Students must spend a specified amount of time in each institution, details of which can be found in the ‘Notes’ section of the Travel Plan form . It is recommended that students submit applications for the Joint PhD programme by the end of March to begin the following September.
