Yet there is latent acceptance of the significant role that leadership plays in both development and security processes and outcomes. This MPhil/PhD programme provides the academic space, support and training for students to interrogate these dynamics to produce knowledge that focuses on these issues.

In conjunction with non-MR methods such as microscopy and autoradiography, this multifaceted approach enhances our understanding of the patho-physiological mechanisms underlying disease and informs the development of novel therapeutic interventions. In addition, improved understanding of the biological processes that underlie MR signal changes advances the crucial role of MR in non-invasive assessment of neuropsychiatric disease.

The Medical Humanities are a growing field of scholarship that produces powerful, innovative analyses of todayâs healthcare issues. You will study the fundamentals of the field and develop analytical and critical skills that will enable you to address questions such as: Does studying the humanities make us more humane? How are the humanities different from the sciences, and what new angles do they offer on old ethical dilemmas? What is health? What is illness? What kind of evidence about illness does literature provide? What is narrative and how embedded are narrative ways of thought in health care practice? You will leave us with a deep understanding of how a variety of humanities disciplines conceive of health and illness and of the contributions these can make to healthcare. The disciplines we cover include Philosophy, Literature, Film, Psychiatry, Art History and Nursing, leading to skills in the visual, bioethical, literary, historical and philosophical analyses of healthcare.

Teaching You can typically expect: The equivalent of over 50 days of academic sessions at King’s (typically three hours in the morning and/or afternoon spread throughout the academic year). Approximately 120 days of teaching placement.* This includes a short period of placement in primary schools (typically four days). A number of one to one tutorials totaling five to seven sessions across the year. Two visits from a tutor whilst on placement to observe lessons and monitor progress Regular** meetings with a mentor, who will be a member of staff at your placement school, whilst on placement. Written feedback on all credit-bearing assignments within four weeks of the deadline. * This 120 day figure represents the standard number of placement days. In certain cases, following assessment by course tutors and mentors, students may be required to undertake a greater number of placement days to demonstrate their ability to meet the Teacher Standards. ** Typically each trainee will have a meeting with their mentor during each week they are on placement. In certain circumstances the frequency may vary. The types of learning commitment encompassed within the course vary depending on modules. For this course one credit represents the equivalent of 10 hours of learning and engagement.   The breakdown below gives you an idea of the likely workload you can expect: Professional Practice in Education (45-credit module): This module covers the teaching practice that students carry out in secondary schools. As such, much of the time commitment is dedicated to teaching and planning lessons.  Seminars/Tutorials: 14 contact hours (seminars/tutorials designed to evaluate teaching performance and provide feedback). Teaching: 200-220 hours of teaching (this includes time teaching by oneself and ‘team teaching’ in groups). Self study/assignment work: 216 hours to include lesson planning, observing lessons, marking pupils work.   School Data (15-credit module): Lectures/seminars: 10 contact hours. Self-study/assignment work: 140 hours.   Studying Policy & Professional Practice (30-credit module): Lectures/seminars: 25.5 contact hours. Self-study/assignment work: 274.5 hours.   Focused Pedagogical Studies (30-credit module): Lectures/seminars: 200 contact hours. Self-study/assignment work: 100 hours.   Assessment The 45-credit honours-level module will be assessed by a combination of a written portfolio (equivalent to 8,000 words) and assessment of your teaching practice against the Teaching Standards as set out by the government’s Department for Education. Progress in meeting the teaching standards will be monitored through three progress reports that will be completed by staff at the placement school. The 30-credit master’s-level modules will each be assessed by a 6,000 word written assignment heavily based on in-school research that trainees undertake. The 15-credit honours-level module will be assessed by an assignment focusing on data collection methods in the school environment. Location Students undertake placements in secondary schools that work in partnership with King’s College London. Partnership schools are located across central London and the Greater London area. Whilst every effort is made to place PGCE trainees in local schools, due to the changing nature of initial teacher education and limited availability of placements in certain subject areas, trainees should be prepared to travel to their placement schools throughout the Greater London area and beyond. Students also organise their own short placements at state primary schools. Our PGCE Religious Education course is set in the heart of London. We work in close partnership with schools in designing, delivering and assessing our course. You will have the opportunity to work with tutors who are actively engaged in research and are encouraged to take a critical view of policies and practice.

Both are needed to secure careers in humanitarian and development organisations. Professional exposure and networking is delivered through four mechanisms: 1. Environmental Internship . This is a stand alone module based on one to two weeks full-time equivalent working in a host organisation: usually a Humanitarian or Development NGO headquaters office in London or as part of a research team working on disaster risk within the Department of Geography. The student will undertake a defined task, typically a literature or policy review to feed into policy development work. The module is assessed by a reflective essay on the experience and lessons learned. The internship is appropriate for those wishing an introduction to professional life in the sector, some internships can turn into thesis research ideas. 2. Thesis placements . These allow students to undertake their three month research project within an international humanitarian or development NGO in the field. Current partners include the Red Cross Climate Centre, Oxfam, Save the Children, YCARE and the All India Disaster Mitigation Institute. Students propose thesis ideas and these are crafted with host organisations to make sure they meet academic criteria and policy impact goals. Typically thesis research is translated into a policy brief. Host organisation commitments vary but all local costs (translation, accommodation, transport) are covered, and often international transport costs as well.  An example of a thesis internship can be found  here. 3. Post-degree internships.  Increasingly employers look for experience and are also prepared to offer paid internships. We only partner with internship providers providing at least basic living costs. Current internships providers are the Stockholm Environment Institute - Asia and the Asian Disaster Preparedness Centre, both based in Bangkok. Post degree internships are three months commencing in September - think about this being a 15 month degree where you get paid for the final three months! 4. Networking events.  because the Disasters, Adaptation and development programme is associated with King's Centre for Integrated Research on Risk and Resilience (CIRRR) students are encouraged to attend its seminars and social events. Monthly meetings and occasional seminars help to integrated masters students with researchers and policy actors with many opportunities to become informally involved in research and outreach.   We recommend that you submit your application as soon as possible.  Our first application deadline is the 30th March 2018.  Applications will remain open if places are available and programmes will be closed as soon as they are full.

Dr Daanish Mustafa    Please note: Current regulations allow some students to pay UK tuition fees on the basis of their EU citizenship or residency. Until these eligibility criteria are changed, the EU tuition fee will remain the same as the UK tuition fee.  These tuition fees may be subject to additional increases in subsequent years of study, in line with King’s terms and conditions. Deposit When you receive an offer for this course you will be required to pay a non-refundable deposit to secure your place. The deposit will be credited towards your total fee payment. The UK/EU deposit is £500. The INTERNATIONAL deposit is £2,000.  If you receive an offer on or before 31st March 2018, payment is due by 27th April 2018. If you receive an offer between 1st April 2018 and 30th June 2018, payment is due within one month of receiving the offer. If you receive an offer between 1st July 2018 and 31st July 2018, payment is due within two weeks of receiving the offer. If you receive an offer on or after 1st August 2018, payment is due within one week of receiving the offer. If you are a current King’s student in receipt of the  King's Living Bursary  you are not required to pay a deposit to secure your place on the programme.

Additional costs/expenses In addition to your tuition fees, you can also expect to pay for:  Books if you choose to buy your own copies  Clothing for optional course related events and competitions  Library fees and fines  Personal photocopies  Printing course handouts  Society membership fees  Stationery  Travel costs for travel around London and between campuses Graduation costs Some modules include the option to undertake other short day-trip fieldwork. These fieldwork options will enhance the modules, but they are not assessed as part of the module. The additional costs for short day-trip fieldwork would typically not exceed £50 per year.  Costs may be incurred for dissertation work if fieldwork and/or laboratory materials are needed for the chosen study topic, but such work is not mandatory and would not impact academic success if an alternative approach to dissertation research is taken. Please visit our web pages on  fees and funding  for more information.   Teaching We will teach you through a combination of lectures and seminars, and you will typically have 20 hours of this per 20 credit module. We also expect you to undertake 180 hours of independent study for each module, although some modules in the Geography Department may involve lab work or e-learning which would require less self-guided learning. For your 12,000 word dissertation, we will provide four workshops and five hours of one-to-one supervision to complement your 587 hours of independent study. Typically, one credit equates to 10 hours of work. Assessment Performance on taught modules in the Geography Department is normally assessed through essays and other written assignments, oral presentations, lab work and occasionally by examination, depending on the modules selected. All students also undertake a research-based dissertation of 12,000 words. The Disasters, Adaptation & Development MA, MSc course takes a social development perspective, exploring topics such as human vulnerability, response to natural and technological hazards and to hazards associated with climate change.

A rigorous approach to quantitative finance taught entirely by the Department of Mathematics. In-depth coverage of the skills needed for working in the financial, actuarial or related industry: probability theory, optimisation, statistics and computer implementation. Unrivalled facilities in central London with City of London's financial centre close by, and with access to live market data in our Bloomberg Data Laboratory. Flexible study programme offering the opportunity to study part-time. King’s is a member of the London Graduate School in Mathematical Finance which provides advanced courses for students who wish to push beyond the MSc core syllabus. Lecturers on the programme have extensive experience in consulting and work for financial companies and institutions such as Bank of Finland, Commerzbank, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, ION Trading, Standard Chartered Bank and Winton Capital Management. Financial Mathematics studies problems of optimal investment and risk management, and this course covers a diverse range of topics, from classical options pricing to post-crisis investment and risk management Like any branch of applied mathematics, financial mathematics analyses a given problem by first building a mathematical model for it and then examining the model. Both steps require detailed knowledge in different areas of mathematics, including probability, statistics, optimisation, computer science and many more traditional fields of mathematics. Our Financial Mathematics MSc course is a unique study pathway that encompasses the essential skills required for successful risk management, trading and research in quantitative finance: probability, statistics, optimisation, computing and financial markets. You will explore probability theories, risk neutral valuation, stochastic analysis as well as interest rate and credit risk modules. We also offer you the opportunity to study an additional zero-credit supportive module called mathematical analysis for financial mathematics. The Financial Mathematics MSc programme offers you the choice to study either full or part-time and is made up of optional and required modules. You must take modules totalling 180 credits to complete the course. If you are studying full-time, you will complete the course in one year, from September to September. If you are studying part-time, your programme will take two years to complete, you will study the required modules in the first year, and a further selection of required and optional modules including the 60-credit financial mathematics report module in your second year. Bloomberg terminal laboratory King’s is one of only a few academic departments in the UK that offers full access to Bloomberg terminals. These terminals will provide you access to live financial data. They are heavily used within the financial industry, and the data they provide is critical in assisting traders in making investment decisions and for risk managers monitoring investment probabilities. We have 13 Bloomberg terminals available for exclusive use by the Financial Mathematics MSc programme. You will use the Bloomberg terminals to: Gain an intuition for the conduct of real financial markets Develop potential investment strategies Experience using real-world investment and risk management software and obtain data for research. The skills you will learn from using the terminals are highly valued by employers. King’s is part of a strong network of financial mathematics in London with connections both in academia and in the industry. We are also members of the University of London and by arrangement, you can enrol in optional modules at other institutions within the University of London, which includes Birkbeck, London School of Economics and Political Sciences, University College London and many others. https://www.kcl.ac.uk/study/postgraduate/apply/enquiry-form.aspx ","type":"PGT"},"entryTitle":"Financial Mathematics","sys":{"id":"006ce891-0000-0000-0000-000000000000","uri":"/api/delivery/projects/website/entries/006ce891-0000-0000-0000-000000000000","projectId":"website","contentTypeId":"courses","dataFormat":"entry","language":"en-GB","metadata":{},"properties":{},"version":{"createdBy":"SearchDataImport","created":"2018-01-26T18:06:13.6843762Z","modifiedBy":"SearchDataImport","modified":"2018-01-26T18:06:13.6843762Z","publishedBy":"SearchDataImport","published":"2018-01-26T18:06:14.0280975Z","versionNo":"1.0"},"owner":"SearchDataImport"}},{"title":"Global Ethics & Human Values","description":"<p class=\"Body\">Our Global Ethics &amp; Human Values course will encourage and develop your thinking about the complex theoretical and practical issues confronting the world and equip you with the analytical skills to address those issues with philosophical rigour.
