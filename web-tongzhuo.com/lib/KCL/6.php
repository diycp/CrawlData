Until these eligibility criteria are changed, the EU tuition fee will remain the same as the UK tuition fee.  These tuition fees may be subject to additional increases in subsequent years of study, in line with King’s terms and conditions. Additional costs/expenses In addition to your tuition fees, you can also expect to pay for:  Books, if you choose to buy your own copies  Clothing for optional course related events and competitions Course packs, which are a vital part of your learning at King's and normally contain extracts from books and other useful documents that will inform your study.

The National College of Teaching and Leadership provides tax free bursaries for teacher training courses. Bursaries range from £4,000-£30,000 depending on the subject area you are training in and your academic qualifications. For information on rates and eligibility please visit  getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/funding-and-salary/overview  or contact the King’s Admissions Office. King’s will automatically assess your eligibility for a bursary when a place on a PGCE course is offered. King’s will apply for the funding on your behalf once the terms of your offer have been met and you have enrolled on the course. Teaching You can typically expect: the equivalent of over 50 days of academic sessions at King’s (typically three hours in the morning and/or afternoon spread throughout the academic year) approximately 120 days of teaching placement.* This includes a short period of placement in primary schools (typically between five to nine days in length) five to seven tutorials across the year two visits from a tutor whilst on placement to observe lessons and monitor progress regular** meetings with a mentor, who will be a member of staff at your placement school, whilst on placement written feedback on all credit-bearing assignments within four weeks of the deadline. *This 120 day figure represents the standard number of placement days. In certain cases, following assessment by course tutors and mentors, students may be required to undertake a greater number of placement days to demonstrate their ability to meet the Teacher Standards. **Typically each trainee will have a meeting with their mentor during each week they are on placement. In certain circumstances the frequency may vary. The types of learning commitment encompassed within the course vary depending on modules. For this course one credit represents the equivalent of 10 hours of learning and engagement. Professional Practice in Education (45-credit module) This module covers the teaching practice that students carry out in secondary schools. As such, much of the time commitment is dedicated to teaching and planning lessons.  Seminars/tutorials: 14 contact hours (seminars/tutorials designed to evaluate teaching performance and provide feedback). Teaching: 200-220 hours of teaching (this includes time teaching by oneself and ‘team teaching’ in groups). Self study/assignment work: 216 hours to include lesson planning, observing lessons, marking pupils work. School Data (15 credit module) Lectures/seminars: 10 contact hours Self-study/ assignment work: 140 hours Studying Policy & Professional Practice (30-credit module) Lectures/seminars: 25.5 contact hours Self-study/assignment work: 274.5 hours of self-study Focused Pedagogical Studies (30-credit module) Lectures/seminars: 200 contact hours. Self-study/assignment work: 100 hours of self-study Assessment The 45-credit honours-level module will be assessed by a combination of a written portfolio (equivalent to 8,000 words) and assessment of your teaching practice against the Teaching Standards as set out by the government’s Department for Education. Progress in meeting the teaching standards will be monitored through three progress reports that will be completed by staff at the placement school. The 30-credit master’s-level modules will each be assessed by a 6,000 word written assignment heavily based on in-school research that trainees undertakes. The 15-credit honours-level module will be assessed by an assignment focusing on data collection methods in the school environment. The study time and assessment methods detailed above are typical and give you a good indication of what to expect. Location Students undertake placements in secondary schools that work in partnership with King’s College London. Partnership schools are located across central London and the Greater London area. Whilst every effort is made to place PGCE trainees in local schools, due to the changing nature of initial teacher education and limited availability of placements in certain subject areas, trainees should be prepared to travel to their placement schools throughout the Greater London area and beyond. Students also organise their own short placement at a state primary school. Further information on this short placement is provided in the offer holder pack and during the course. The PGCE Chemistry provides a clear, thoughtful and critical introduction to teaching Chemistry, drawing on leading education research carried out at King’s. We work in close partnership with schools in designing, delivering and assessing our course in order to develop excellent, reflective classroom practitioners. The course information sheet is a printable version of the information on this web page, which you can download  here for PGCE Chemistry, and  here  for the PGCE Chemistry: School Direct Route. Courses are divided into modules. You will normally take modules totalling 120 credits. King’s College London reviews the modules offered on a regular basis to provide up-to-date, innovative and relevant programmes of study. Therefore, modules offered may change. We suggest you keep an eye on this course page for updates.  http://www.kcl.ac.uk/sspp/departments/education/study/pgce/pgcefaqs.aspx Applications are made through the central national system for applying for teacher training courses. UCAS-Teacher Training, Rosehill New Barn Lane Cheltenham GL52 3LZ Tel: +44 (0)1242 544788 www.ucas.com   Visit our admissions webpages to view our  English language entry requirements. General entry advice Our PGCE programmes all require a minimum of: Bachelor's degree with at least 2:1 honours (or overseas equivalent) usually in the subject you wish to teach.  Knowledge and understanding of the subject you intend to teach. GCSE grade C or above (or an equivalent qualification) in English language and mathematics. Applicants without these English or mathematics qualifications at the time they apply may be considered, but they must obtain them, or pass an equivalent test set by King's, before the course starts. For further guidance see our Chemistry  FAQs Key benefits Our chemistry course, judged Outstanding by Ofsted, is taught by one of the strongest team of science education tutors in the country. One reason that the PGCE was judged Outstanding is the strong research base which informs the course. In the last research assessment exercise, the department was rated as one of the top three in the UK. We work in partnership with a wide range of schools in London and beyond, providing a unique opportunity to learn how to teach the full diversity of students. We prepare you to teach outside the classroom: there is a residential field trip and several other opportunities to make best use of what London has to offer the science teacher, from the South Bank to the Natural History Museum. During the year you will spend over 50 days at King’s and 120 days in schools. You will work with other trainees and tutors in your subject area to consider the principles and practice of teaching your subject including curriculum design, the development of materials, classroom management and lesson planning. You will also work with trainees from other subjects in a programme of lectures and seminar groups to examine a broad range of educational issues. During both secondary school placements there are occasional days in college for tutorials to support and monitor progress towards the standards for Qualified Teacher Status (QTS). There are crosscurricular research tasks and assignments. There are two blocks of school experience, one starting in the autumn and the other in the spring. You will spend time observing other teachers and their classes before beginning to teach yourself. You will teach more during the second school experience than you will in the first one.

Overview A degree geared both to philosophy graduates to consolidate and expand their philosophical grounding, and equally to conversion students to introduce them to key concepts, arguments, texts and techniques from across the philosophical spectrum, while also bringing them up to a high level in selected specialist areas. The course information sheet is a printable version of the information on this web page, which you can download here . There will be different pathways for conversion and non-conversion students. Over the duration of the course you will earn a total of 180 credits. Sixty of these will come from a dissertation of around 12,000 words, which you will complete over the Summer at the end of the course. If you satisfactorily complete the course before the dissertation, you can exit the course without completing a dissertation and we will award you a Postgraduate Diploma in Philosophy on the basis of your 120 credits. You will earn your initial 120 credits through your choice of optional modules. You will take most of these in your first or second semester, and they are each worth 20 credits; General Philosophy is the exception; it spans both semesters and is worth 40. If you do not have a background in Philosophy, we will normally expect you to take this module. It will introduce you to basic philosophical methods, techniques and terminology, and it will acquaint you with some of the most important and influential writings on the subject. Otherwise, you will have a completely free choice of modules, although you should note that some modules are likely to be more accessible to students without a philosophical background, while others, particularly the more specialised‘topics’-based modules, might appeal more to those who do already have a grounding in the field. Optional modules are mostly taught through two hours of lectures and seminars every week. If you gain permission, you may take up to 40 credits from modules outside the Department of Philosophy. If you are studying full-time, you will complete the course in one year, from September to September. If you are studying part-time, your course will take two years, and you are required to gain 40 to 80 credits (but normally 60 or 80) in your first year, and then 100 to 140 (but normally 100 to 120, including 60 from the dissertation) in your second. If you take General Philosophy, you must take it in your first year. Applications must be made online using King’s online application portal apply.kcl.ac.uk and a non-refundable application fee of £55 applies. With your application form, you must include a sample of written work totalling approximately 3,000 words. We do not routinely interview applicants, but we may call you for interview; and you are very welcome to call the department to arrange a visit. We aim to process all complete applications within four to six weeks, although this may take longer over holiday periods.

The Department offers a  Graduate Diploma in Classical Studies , which can act as a conversion course for those with degrees in other areas who want to go on to take the MA Classics.    Key benefits One of the world's largest and most distinguished Departments of Classics. Unrivalled location for the study of the ancient world thanks to London's unique range of specialist libraries, museums and galleries. Extraordinarily wide choice of modules, drawing on the resources of the whole of the University of London. King's graduates enjoy one of the best employment rates and starting salaries in the UK. Ranked 6th in the UK for graduate employment (Times and Sunday Times Good Universities Guide 2016) The MA programme in Classics is organised on an intercollegiate basis, so that we can combine the expertise of staff in all three of the participating colleges - King's, UCL and Royal Holloway. The course centres on the University's  Institute of Classical Studies , which not only contains a world-class research library, but also hosts the richest programme of seminars, conferences, and occasional lectures for this subject area in the UK.  To further add to the breadth of our course, you can also take appropriate modules from other MA courses at King's. You will study modules through texts in the original languages as well as through translated texts. Besides purely literary and linguistic topics, you can also take modules in Ancient History, Classical Archaeology & Art and Late Antique & Byzantine Studies, including Latin and Ancient Greek at both a beginner’s and intermediate level. If you intend to pursue further research in Classics, you are likely to find particular value in the unique opportunities to acquire technical skills in the handling of documentary evidence, provided by modules in Greek Papyrology, Greek & Roman Epigraphy, and Greek & Latin Palaeography. Libraries As well as the extensive library resources at King's, you will have access to the world-leading Classics library at the Institute of Classical Studies, as well as other University of London libraries. Research seminars In the Department of Classics we run a  research seminar series  (which MA students are encouraged to attend), where you will learn about the current research of our academic staff and PhD students.  Further the Department regularly hosts major research conferences with guest speakers from around the world.  There are also University of London research seminars organized through the Institute of Classical Studies, for example in Literature, Classical Archaeology and Ancient History, where you will be able to listen to and meet leading scholars from around the world. There is also the  Late Antique & Byzantine Studies seminar , which is organized by the Centre for Hellenic Studies. Personal tutor You will be assigned a personal tutor in the Department of Classics, who will advise you and help you decide which modules to take, and can answer any questions or concerns you may have whilst at King's. Dissertation supervision During your first term at King's you will need to decide on your MA dissertation subject, if you have not done so before you arrive. The dissertation can be related to work you are doing for a taught module, or it can be in a completely different area. On the basis of your chosen subject area you will be assigned a supervisor within the Department of Classics who will discuss the topic with you, and oversee your work on it.

Bursaries range from £4,000-£30,000 depending on the subject area you are training in and your academic qualifications. For information on rates and eligibility please visit  getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/funding-and-salary/overview  or contact the King’s Admissions Office.

Teaching You can typically expect: the equivalent of over 50 days of academic sessions at King’s (typically three hours in the morning and/or afternoon spread throughout the academic year) approximately 120 days of teaching placement.* This includes a short period of placement in primary schools (typically four days) a number of one to one tutorials totaling five to seven sessions across the year two visits from a tutor whilst on placement to observe lessons and monitor progress regular** meetings with a mentor, who will be a member of staff at your placement school, whilst on placement written feedback on all credit-bearing assignments within four weeks of the deadline. *This 120 day figure represents the standard number of placement days. In certain cases, following assessment by course tutors and mentors, students may be required to undertake a greater number of placement days to demonstrate their ability to meet the Teacher Standards. **Typically each trainee will have a meeting with their mentor during each week they are on placement. In certain circumstances the frequency may vary. The types of learning commitment encompassed within the course vary depending on modules. For this course one credit represents the equivalent of 10 hours of learning and engagement. Professional Practice in Education (45-credit module) This module covers the teaching practice that students carry out in secondary schools. As such, much of the time commitment is dedicated to teaching and planning lessons.  Seminars/tutorials: 14 contact hours (seminars/tutorials designed to evaluate teaching performance and provide feedback). Teaching: 200-220 hours of teaching (this includes time teaching by oneself and ‘team teaching’ in groups). Self study/assignment work: 216 hours to include lesson planning, observing lessons, marking pupils work. School Data (15 credit module) Lectures/seminars: 10 contact hours Self-study/ assignment work: 140 hours Studying Policy & Professional Practice (30-credit module) Lectures/seminars: 25.5 contact hours Self-study/assignment work: 274.5 hours of self-study Focused Pedagogical Studies (30-credit module) Lectures/seminars: 200 contact hours. Self-study/assignment work: 100 hours of self-study Assessment The 45-credit honours-level module will be assessed by a combination of a written portfolio (equivalent to 8,000 words) and assessment of your teaching practice against the Teaching Standards as set out by the government’s Department for Education. Progress in meeting the teaching standards will be monitored through three progress reports that will be completed by staff at the placement school. The 30-credit master’s-level modules will each be assessed by a written assignment of 6,000 words heavily based on in-school research that trainees undertakes. The 15-credit honours-level module will be assessed by an assignment focusing on data collection methods in the school environment. The study time and assessment methods detailed above are typical and give you a good indication of what to expect.   Location Students undertake placements in secondary schools that work in partnership with King’s College London. Partnership schools are located across central London and the Greater London area. Whilst every effort is made to place PGCE trainees in local schools, due to the changing nature of initial teacher education and limited availability of placements in certain subject areas, trainees should be prepared to travel to their placement schools throughout the Greater London area and beyond. Students also organise their own short placement at a state primary school. Further information on this short placement is provided during the course. We work in close partnership with schools in designing, delivering and assessing our course. You will have the opportunity to work with tutors who are actively engaged in research as well as expert classroom practitioners.  Courses are divided into modules, and students on this course take modules totalling 120 credits. King’s College London reviews the modules offered on a regular basis to provide up-to-date, innovative and relevant programmes of study. Therefore, modules offered may change.

During both secondary school placements there are occasional days in college for tutorials to support and monitor progress towards the standards for Qualified Teacher Status (QTS). There are cross-curricular research tasks and assignments. School based: For 24 of the 37 weeks the training takes place in schools, mainly in two complementary secondary schools but a short primary school experience. This introduces you to recognising key constituents of good teaching, helps develop your own teaching skills and gain an understanding of how schools work and how children learn. Some trainees undertake part of their teaching practice in France, Spain or Germany, funded by the Erasmus programme.
