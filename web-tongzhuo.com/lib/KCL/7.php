In certain circumstances the frequency may vary. The types of learning commitment encompassed within the course vary depending on modules. For this course one credit represents the equivalent of 10 hours of learning and engagement. Professional Practice in Education (45-credit module) This module covers the teaching practice that students carry out in secondary schools. As such, much of the time commitment is dedicated to teaching and planning lessons.  Seminars/tutorials: 14 contact hours (seminars/tutorials designed to evaluate teaching performance and provide feedback). Teaching: 200-220 hours of teaching (this includes time teaching by oneself and ‘team teaching’ in groups). Self study/assignment work: 216 hours to include lesson planning, observing lessons, marking pupils work. School Data (15 credit module) Lectures/seminars: 10 contact hours Self-study/ assignment work: 140 hours Studying Policy & Professional Practice (30-credit module) Lectures/seminars: 25.5 contact hours Self-study/assignment work: 274.5 hours of self-study Focused Pedagogical Studies (30-credit module) Lectures/seminars: 200 contact hours. Self-study/assignment work: 100 hours of self-study Assessment The 45-credit honours-level module will be assessed by a combination of a written portfolio (equivalent to 8,000 words) and assessment of your teaching practice against the Teaching Standards as set out by the government’s Department for Education. Progress in meeting the teaching standards will be monitored through three progress reports that will be completed by staff at the placement school. The 30-credit master’s-level modules will each be assessed by a 6,000 word written assignment heavily based on in-school research that trainees undertakes. The 15-credit honours-level module will be assessed by an assignment focusing on data collection methods in the school environment. The study time and assessment methods detailed above are typical and give you a good indication of what to expect. Location Students undertake placements in secondary schools that work in partnership with King’s College London. Partnership schools are located across central London and the Greater London area. Whilst every effort is made to place PGCE trainees in local schools, due to the changing nature of initial teacher education and limited availability of placements in certain subject areas, trainees should be prepared to travel to their placement schools throughout the Greater London area and beyond. Students also organise their own short placement at a state primary school. Further information on this short placement is provided in the offer holder pack and during the course. The PGCE Chemistry provides a clear, thoughtful and critical introduction to teaching Chemistry, drawing on leading education research carried out at King’s. We work in close partnership with schools in designing, delivering and assessing our course in order to develop excellent, reflective classroom practitioners. The course information sheet is a printable version of the information on this web page, which you can download  here for PGCE Chemistry, and  here  for the PGCE Chemistry: School Direct Route. Courses are divided into modules. You will normally take modules totalling 120 credits. King’s College London reviews the modules offered on a regular basis to provide up-to-date, innovative and relevant programmes of study. Therefore, modules offered may change. We suggest you keep an eye on this course page for updates.  http://www.kcl.ac.uk/sspp/departments/education/study/pgce/pgcefaqs.aspx Applications are made through the central national system for applying for teacher training courses. UCAS-Teacher Training, Rosehill New Barn Lane Cheltenham GL52 3LZ Tel: +44 (0)1242 544788 www.ucas.com   Visit our admissions webpages to view our  English language entry requirements. General entry advice Our PGCE programmes all require a minimum of: Bachelor's degree with at least 2:1 honours (or overseas equivalent) usually in the subject you wish to teach.  Knowledge and understanding of the subject you intend to teach. GCSE grade C or above (or an equivalent qualification) in English language and mathematics. Applicants without these English or mathematics qualifications at the time they apply may be considered, but they must obtain them, or pass an equivalent test set by King's, before the course starts. For further guidance see our Chemistry  FAQs Key benefits Our chemistry course, judged Outstanding by Ofsted, is taught by one of the strongest team of science education tutors in the country. One reason that the PGCE was judged Outstanding is the strong research base which informs the course. In the last research assessment exercise, the department was rated as one of the top three in the UK. We work in partnership with a wide range of schools in London and beyond, providing a unique opportunity to learn how to teach the full diversity of students. We prepare you to teach outside the classroom: there is a residential field trip and several other opportunities to make best use of what London has to offer the science teacher, from the South Bank to the Natural History Museum. During the year you will spend over 50 days at King’s and 120 days in schools. You will work with other trainees and tutors in your subject area to consider the principles and practice of teaching your subject including curriculum design, the development of materials, classroom management and lesson planning. You will also work with trainees from other subjects in a programme of lectures and seminar groups to examine a broad range of educational issues. During both secondary school placements there are occasional days in college for tutorials to support and monitor progress towards the standards for Qualified Teacher Status (QTS). There are crosscurricular research tasks and assignments. There are two blocks of school experience, one starting in the autumn and the other in the spring. You will spend time observing other teachers and their classes before beginning to teach yourself. You will teach more during the second school experience than you will in the first one. During the year you will also spend time in a primary school so that you can see what pupils experience before they arrive in secondary schools. The course includes residential fieldwork based at the Field Studies Council centre in Surrey. There are many other opportunities for you to develop your abilities to teach beyond the classroom, in the school grounds and beyond. https://www.kcl.ac.uk/study/postgraduate/apply/enquiry-form.aspx ","type":"PGT"},"entryTitle":"Postgraduate Certificate in Education (Chemistry)","sys":{"id":"006cfd38-0000-0000-0000-000000000000","uri":"/api/delivery/projects/website/entries/006cfd38-0000-0000-0000-000000000000","projectId":"website","contentTypeId":"courses","dataFormat":"entry","language":"en-GB","metadata":{},"properties":{},"version":{"createdBy":"SearchDataImport","created":"2018-01-26T18:03:36.1225356Z","modifiedBy":"SearchDataImport","modified":"2018-01-26T18:03:36.1225356Z","publishedBy":"SearchDataImport","published":"2018-01-26T18:03:36.528788Z","versionNo":"1.0"},"owner":"SearchDataImport"}},{"title":"Advanced Computing with Management","description":"<p>The Advanced Computing with Management MSc is an innovative course designed to provide you with an in-depth understanding of management roles within the IT industry.

The PGCert in Research Methods for Social Science & Health is a unique study pathway that provides professionals, practitioners and researchers with advanced understanding and skills for the practical application of quantitative and qualitative research methods. It provides an excellent foundation for understanding, conducting and using social science research in policy, medicine and healthcare. In addition, it enables students to develop a critical understanding of research methods, supplying them with the skills to commission or undertake their own original research. Courses are divided into modules. You will normally take modules totalling 60 credits. King’s College London reviews the modules offered on a regular basis to provide up-todate innovative and relevant programmes of study. Therefore, modules offered may change.

Teaching We use lectures, seminars and group tutorials to deliver most of the modules on the programme. You will also be expected to undertake a significant amount of independent study.   Lectures, seminars & feedback Self-directed study Per 15-credit taught module The total contact time for each 15-credit taught module is approximately 30 hours. These sessions will include lectures, teacher-led and student-led group discussions based on the main areas of study. Students are expected to do at least one hour of self-directed study for each taught hour of lectures. You may find that you need to study more or less than this for specific topics, depending on your background.  In addition, a consolidation week primarily for self-directed study is scheduled during Week 6 of each module’s lecture schedule. Additional self-directed study time will be required to complete module assignments and to revise for examinations. Dissertation module There is no formal limit to the number of hours of contact with dissertation project supervisors, this varies between projects and according to the needs of the student. Formal timetabled compulsory dissertation training sessions are provided. The dissertation module requires a significant level of self-directed study, the bulk of which is done over the summer months after formal teaching has ended.   Students should ensure they can allocate sufficient self-directed study time to their dissertation project over the summer months, in order to meet the deadline in early September.       Typically, one credit equates to 10 hours of work. Assessment The primary method of assessment for this course is a combination of unseen written examinations, coursework and presentations. The research project and dissertation will be assessed on an extended piece of writing.  Examinations are mainly held during Examination Period 1 (January) and Examination Period 2 (May / early June).  The ‘Essentials of Toxicology for Public Health Protection’ examination is, however, normally held during Examination Period 3 (August). Resit and replacement examinations are normally scheduled during Examination Period 3 (August). Resit and replacement examinations for the 'Essentials of Toxicology for Public Health Protection' module are normally  held during the following Examination Period (January). You’ll submit your first piece of summative coursework towards the end of Term 1, and coursework submissions continue into April. The coursework for the ‘Essentials of Toxicology for Public Health Protection’ module is submitted in August. The dissertation is submitted in early September (part-time students submit their dissertation at the end of their second year).  The formal teaching, self-directed study time and assessment methods detailed above are typical and give you a good indication of what to expect. They are however, subject to change. Regulating body King’s College is regulated by the Higher Education Funding Council for England. Attendance requirements The MPH runs from September to September, and all students start in September. Attendance at lectures is compulsory. Most lectures are held during Terms 1 and 2. Each term is normally 12 weeks long. Full-time students typically attend lectures for a total of two days per week and part-time students typically attend lectures for a total of one day per week. A student’s actual days of attendance will depend on which modules they are studying.  Modules are normally scheduled on a Monday, Wednesday or Thurday. Lectures are normally scheduled from 10am to 1pm, or from 2pm to 5pm. Each module normally has one three-hour lecture per week, over a 12-week term. Two of the optional modules are run over one full-time week (Monday – Friday, 9am – 5pm). Essentials of Environmental Public Health Science is normally held during one week in November, and Essentials of Toxicology for Public Health Protection is normally held during one week in late May / early June. Study Leave For an estimate of study leave requirements, an example for a full-time MPH student might be, as a minimum: • Programme Induction – 1 day • Attendance at lectures – 48 days • Attendance at examinations (x 6) – 3 days (6 x ½ days) Please note that this is only an example.  Exact study leave requirements would depend on your optional module choices, attendance at optional sessions, etc., and individual students would need to calculate their total study leave requirements themselves when requesting study leave from their employer.  Students might also need to factor in self-directed study time, if their employer allows for this.  In addition, finalist students must ensure that they can be available on the date of the external examiners’ visit, as external examiners are entitled to interview a sample of finalist students as part of their moderating role. Optional sessions : There are other optional sessions (workshops, tutorials, pre-exam revision sessions, etc.) scheduled throughout the year. Some are occasional lunchtime sessions on lecture days, but students may need to book additional study leave time for some optional sessions (or take annual leave) if they are interested in attending. A few tutorials and events may take place after 5pm – these tutorials and events are also normally optional. Management of your study time The MPH is an intensive programme – and students will need to manage their study time carefully alongside their other commitments in order to complete the programme successfully. We do not advise that students are employed in full-time work whilst undertaking the MPH. Location The majority of learning for this degree takes place at the King’s College London Guy’s Campus. Please note that locations are determined by where each module is taught and may vary depending on the optional modules you select.

Your application will be assessed by two academics (Admissions Tutors). Shortlisted home candidates may be interviewed in person, and shortlisted overseas candidates may be interviewed via Skype (telephone interviews will be conducted as an exception). We aim to process all applications within eight weeks, but please bear in mind that this programme attracts a very large number of applications. During holiday periods, applications may take longer to process. One of the core modules is ‘Basic Epidemiology and Statistics for Public Health’ so all applicants should be confident with their aptitude for numerical reasoning before they start their MPH studies. We therefore encourage applicants before they submit their application to undertake self-assessment regarding their aptitude for numerical reasoning.

Key benefits Will enable students to work across disciplinary and specialism boundaries, and in particular to explore simultaneously the art-historical and theological dimensions of Christian art – approaches which are generally pursued in isolation from one another. Will use rich cultural resources beyond the university – and specifically the artistic, human and web-based resources of the National Gallery. Will provide opportunities for students to learn outside the university, in the context of an art museum, with likely additional visits/links to institutions with related collections, like the Courtauld Gallery, and the Victoria and Albert Museum. Will enhance the experience of international students at the university by giving them a stimulating and privileged understanding of one of London’s (and the world’s) greatest treasuries of art. Our MA in Christianity and the Arts will investigate how Christian scripture, beliefs and practices have found expression in the arts over 2000 years. The course features a required module on the Idea of Beauty in Western Theology and a wide range of optional modules looking at different forms of artistic expression, different artistic periods with a focus on specific elements of the Christian narrative. You will also have the opportunity to explore a topic in detail through your dissertation. Wherever possible the course draws on examples and case studies here in London, particularly the collections at The National Gallery, The Courtauld Institute and The Victoria and Albert Museum.
