Key benefits Our department is unique in the UK and one of the few university departments in the world devoted exclusively to the study of war as a human phenomenon. It is a multidisciplinary institution devoted to the study of all aspects of war and conflict and the broad remit of international relations. Our department has an excellent reputation as a graduate training institution and is recognised by the British Academy, the Arts and Humanities Research Council and the Economic and Social Research council as a training institution for war studies. We place great emphasis on recruiting leading experts who bring with them not only a wealth of knowledge and ideas but an extensive and continually growing network of links with other departments, think-tanks, organisations, policymaking bodies and institutions. Our unrivalled location in the heart of London beside the River Thames brings outstanding advantages. You can enjoy excellent academic, social and cultural opportunities. We are close to the seat of government, the City, Imperial War Museum, National Maritime Museum, Royal Courts of Justice and the Inns of Court. You have access to visiting academics, serving officers, government ministers and other experts who give regular public lectures and seminars. Our MA course provides you with a comprehensive understanding of international conflict. It aims to combine theory and practice, providing advanced engagement with the theoretical and philosophical aspects of the subject as well as training in the investigation and analysis of specific cases of conflict. It enables you to engage critically with the application of social and political theory in developing an understanding of the origins, dynamics and resolution of international and transnational conflict and political violence. You will examine the impact of globalisation on the complexities of present-day conflict; the politics of identity and how it relates to the emergence of violent conflict; the relationship between security, insecurity and the politics of violence at international level; the politics of security and how this relates to human rights and policies surrounding migration; the relationship between language and violent conflict; the place of cultural and gender difference in relation to conflict and peace, as well as the political and ethical implications of the diverse theoretical and methodological approaches in the study of conflict, violence, and peace. https://www.kcl.ac.uk/study/postgraduate/apply/enquiry-form.aspx ","type":"PGT"},"entryTitle":"International Conflict Studies","sys":{"id":"006ce909-0000-0000-0000-000000000000","uri":"/api/delivery/projects/website/entries/006ce909-0000-0000-0000-000000000000","projectId":"website","contentTypeId":"courses","dataFormat":"entry","language":"en-GB","metadata":{},"properties":{},"version":{"createdBy":"SearchDataImport","created":"2018-01-26T18:05:26.579956Z","modifiedBy":"SearchDataImport","modified":"2018-01-26T18:05:26.579956Z","publishedBy":"SearchDataImport","published":"2018-01-26T18:05:27.1424436Z","versionNo":"1.0"},"owner":"SearchDataImport"}},{"title":"Mathematics Education","description":"<p>Throughout the course, you will develop a critical understanding of your professional expertise as well as analysing the learning and teaching of mathematics and their implications for policy and classroom practice.

Teaching For each 30-credit taught module you will typically have 20 hours of class time. The sessions include lecturing, teacher led class discussions and student-led group work. Self-study: You will have 280 hours of self-guided learning time per 30 credit module. For the Academic Study Skills Workshops you will have 10.5 hours of contact time. For the Dissertation module students receive 9 hours of one-to-one dissertation supervision and attend research methods lectures which are an additional 24 hours of contact time. The dissertation will also involve 567 hours of self-guided learning. Assessment The 30-credit taught modules are normally assessed by a 6,000 word assignment. However, assessment methods may vary, depending on the optional modules you select.  There is an online participation requirement for the compulsory taught module. The 60-credit dissertation is assessed by an extended piece of writing of 16,000 words. Students are permitted to take up to 40 of their optional credits from outside of the course, at the discretion of the Programme Director. The contact time and assessment methods for those modules may vary. The study time and assessment methods detailed above are typical and give you a good indication of what to expect. Our Mathematics Education MA will enhance your theoretical and practical understanding of the study of Mathematics in Education. You will study a combination of required and optional modules that will advance your critical understanding and professional expertise. We also offer a range of study topics that will allow you to explore current and future mathematical education practices, policies, curriculum technologies, problems and innovations. The course information sheet is a printable version of the information on this web page, which you can download here. Courses are divided into modules, and students on this course take modules totalling 180-190 credits. The 16,000-word dissertation and a selection of optional study modules will give you the opportunity to personalise your learning pathway to reflect your academic interests. If you are studying full-time, you will complete the 180- 190 credit course in one year, from September to September. If you are studying part-time, your course will take two years to complete. Teachers in full-time employment usually complete the Mathematics in Education MA part-time and study one module in each of the autumn and spring terms in year one, plus a further two modules and the dissertation in year two. Please note: students who are transferring in Master’s level credits (e.g. from the PGCE) will only need to take the number of credits required to bring their total for the course to 180-190, including transferred credits. King’s College London reviews the modules offered on a regular basis to provide up-to-date, innovative and relevant programmes of study. Therefore, modules offered may change. We suggest you keep an eye on this course page. Applications must be made online using King’s online application portal apply.kcl.ac.uk and a non-refundable application fee of £55 applies. Applications will be considered by the Programme Director and one other member of staff. Some UK-based applicants are called for interview. We aim to process all applications within four to six weeks. Maths Education Entry Requirements Minimum UK requirements 2:1 A 2:1 undergraduate degree. Lower undergraduate grades will be considered in certain circumstances, for example if the applicant has a PGCE with master's level credits. It is recommended that applicants have some relevant professional experience, either in teaching or in other educational practice such as policy. However, applications from candidates who do not have any experience but who do have relevant academic qualifications will be considered.

These fieldwork options will enhance the modules, but they are not assessed as part of the module. The additional costs for short day-trip fieldwork would typically not exceed £50 per year.  Costs may be incurred for dissertation work if fieldwork and/or laboratory materials are needed for the chosen study topic, but such work is not mandatory and would not impact academic success if an alternative approach to dissertation research is taken. Please visit our web pages on  fees and funding  for more information. Teaching We will teach you through a combination of lectures and seminars, and you will typically have 20 hours of this per module. We also expect you to undertake 180 hours of independent study for each module. For your 12,000 word dissertation, we will provide four workshops and five hours of one-to-one supervision to complement your 587 hours of independent study. Typically, one credit equates to 10 hours of work. Assessment Performance on taught modules in the Geography Department is normally assessed through essays and other written assignments, oral presentations, lab work and occasionally by examination, depending on the modules selected.
