The MSc Microbiome in Health & Disease consists of 4 taught modules (two covering microbiology, microbial diversity and host-microbiome interactions, and two covering computational analysis of microbiome, and systems and synthetic biology), followed by a lab-based research project.  The taught component will run from September until January, with the research component running from February until August. Teaching comprises conventional lectures, tutorials and computational workshops, supported by example sessions, project work and independent learning via reading material and online courses. During the computational modules, you will be provided with data sets to analyse for written and oral projects. After completing the taught component, you will undertake a lab-based research project for which you will provide a proposal and subsequent dissertation and presentation under the guidance of a supervisor. Teaching The typical hours you will spend as you progress through your studies are as follows: Lectures, seminars & feedback: 214 hours Self-study: 1586 hours Contact time is based on 24 academic weeks and self-study time is based on 31 academic weeks. Typically, one credit equates to 10 hours of work. Assessment You may typically expect assessment by a combination of coursework (76%) and examinations (24%). The study time and assessment methods detailed above are typical and give you a good indication of what to expect. However, they may change if the course modules change.     Dr David Moyes Course director, Dr David Moyes’ research interests focus on Host-Microbiome interactions; Microbiome; Mycobiome; host innate immune responses; epithelial cells and immunity. Recent research outputs include a collaborative and pioneering study to discover a toxin in the fungus Candida albicans , which plays a crucial role during human mucosal infection. Dr Saeed Shoaie Deputy course director, Dr Saeed Shoaie, is Lecturer in Host-Microbiome Systems Biology and Systems Medicine. His research interests focus analysing and integration of (Meta)’omics data in different cohort studies and aim to identify biomarkers and novel treatment strategies for human diseases, generation of genome-scale metabolic models for host and microbiome and apply them in personalized diagnosis and treatment. He has experiences in working with biotech companies and he applies these to set up stable collaborations between academia and industrial biotech companies. Our Microbiome in Health & Disease MSc provides students with a unique background in all aspects of both analysis of microbiome and determining the role of microbiome in pathology with experience in both computational and experimental techniques. Designed and delivered by the newly established Centre for Host-Microbiome Interactions (CHMI) at King’s, the course brings together teaching on a varied course incorporating systems biology and bioinformatics with molecular biology, microbiology, immunology and physiology.

Key benefits Deep understanding of microbial communities and their impact on host health and disease. Focus on translation in clinical, agricultural and environmental challenges. Opportunity to undertake research in collaboration with industrial partners. In the post-human genome project world, our health is dependent on more than our genes. High throughput sequencing reveals the amazing complexity and extent of the microbial communities that reside within or upon us. We are also beginning to understand just how dynamic the interactions between the host and members of communities are. Interactions are diverse, and variations observed between individuals depend on a multitude of microbial and host factors, including diet and inflammatory status. More importantly, it is becoming clear that different disease states are linked to significant changes in the make-up of these communities. Scientists who understand the computational analysis of the huge data sets for microbial communities, and who are also able to interpret findings in the context of human and microbial health, will be in demand across this emerging field in academia and in industry. The MSc Microbiome in Health & Disease will provide you with a deep understanding of microbial communities and their diversity, and the impact of these communities on host health and disease. You will be exposed to the concepts and techniques involved in profiling and analysing large omics data sets associated with characterising and investigating microbial communities. You will learn to analyse omics data sets, such as genome, transcriptome, metabolome and metagenome data, and how to integrate these data to develop a holistic understanding of the interactions between host and microbial communities in both health and disease states. You will also learn how these skills apply in industry and have the opportunity to undertake research in collaboration with industrial partners. You will study the intersection between microbiome and engineering and learn how to identify and develop innovative products in different microbiome fields, applying learning from computational, multiomics analysis and basic biology, through advanced synthetic biology tools, and integrative analysis and modelling, to design new engineered therapeutic microbial communities and optimize their effectiveness in clinical, agricultural and environmental challenges. You will also undertake a 10,000 word supervised dissertation on a subject within the field of microbiome in health and disease.

Interdisciplinary course that enables you to study emerging economies and inclusive development from a variety of different perspectives. Extensive selection of optional modules draw on expertise across King’s with particular emphasis on our Global Institutes. We accept students from a wide range of academic backgrounds as well as mid-career professionals. Our course provides you with high-quality postgraduate teaching and research training in the analysis of emerging economies. It also draws on social scientific expertise from across other departments in the Faculties of Social Sciences & Public Policy and Arts & Humanities, which allows you to explore the topic from a variety of different angles. We examine economic development theory to ask whether emerging economies offer a new model or models of development. We look at the strategies that these countries have adopted to promote development, how inclusive and sustainable or enduring these new strategies are and how emerging markets solve difficult problems of promoting growth over the longer term. To answer this last question, we investigate how these markets manage the development and diffusion of technology, flows of trade and finance, the balance between the state and the market, and problems of institutional underdevelopment and weak systems of law and accountability. https://www.kcl.ac.uk/study/postgraduate/apply/enquiry-form.aspx ","type":"PGT"},"entryTitle":"Emerging Economies and Inclusive Development","sys":{"id":"006cfce1-0000-0000-0000-000000000000","uri":"/api/delivery/projects/website/entries/006cfce1-0000-0000-0000-000000000000","projectId":"website","contentTypeId":"courses","dataFormat":"entry","language":"en-GB","metadata":{},"properties":{},"version":{"createdBy":"SearchDataImport","created":"2018-01-26T18:04:18.9704002Z","modifiedBy":"SearchDataImport","modified":"2018-01-26T18:04:18.9704002Z","publishedBy":"SearchDataImport","published":"2018-01-26T18:04:19.3141513Z","versionNo":"1.0"},"owner":"SearchDataImport"}},{"title":"Postgraduate Certificate in Education (Physics with Mathematics)","description":"<p>Our course combines the theory and practice of education which is why you spend over 50 days at university and 120 days in schools.

For information on rates and eligibility please visit  getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/funding-and-salary/overview  or contact the King’s Admissions Office. King’s will automatically assess your eligibility for a bursary when a place on a PGCE course is offered. King’s will apply for the funding on your behalf once the terms of your offer have been met and you have enrolled on the course.   Teaching You can typically expect: The equivalent of over 50 days of academic sessions at King’s (typically three hours in the morning and/or afternoon spread throughout the academic year). Approximately 120 days of teaching placement.* This includes a short period of placement in primary schools (typically four days). A number of one to one tutorials totaling five to seven sessions across the year. Two visits from a tutor whilst on placement to observe lessons and monitor progress Regular** meetings with a mentor, who will be a member of staff at your placement school, whilst on placement. Written feedback on all credit-bearing assignments within four weeks of the deadline. * This 120 day figure represents the standard number of placement days. In certain cases, following assessment by course tutors and mentors, students may be required to undertake a greater number of placement days to demonstrate their ability to meet the Teacher Standards. ** Typically each trainee will have a meeting with their mentor during each week they are on placement. In certain circumstances the frequency may vary. The types of learning commitment encompassed within the course vary depending on modules. For this course one credit represents the equivalent of 10 hours of learning and engagement.   The breakdown below gives you an idea of the likely workload you can expect:  Professional Practice in Education (45-credit module): This module covers the teaching practice that students carry out in secondary schools. As such, much of the time commitment is dedicated to teaching and planning lessons.  Seminars/Tutorials: 14 contact hours (seminars/tutorials designed to evaluate teaching performance and provide feedback). Teaching: 200-220 hours of teaching (this includes time teaching by oneself and ‘team teaching’ in groups). Self study/assignment work: 216 hours to include lesson planning, observing lessons, marking pupils work.   School Data (15-credit module): Lectures/seminars: 10 contact hours. Self-study/assignment work: 140 hours.   Studying Policy & Professional Practice (30-credit module): Lectures/seminars: 25.5 contact hours. Self-study/assignment work: 274.5 hours.   Focused Pedagogical Studies (30-credit module): Lectures/seminars: 200 contact hours. Self-study/assignment work: 100 hours.   Assessment The 45-credit honours-level module will be assessed by a combination of a written portfolio (equivalent to 8,000 words) and assessment of your teaching practice against the Teaching Standards as set out by the government’s Department for Education. Progress in meeting the teaching standards will be monitored through three progress reports that will be completed by staff at the placement school. The 30-credit master’s-level modules will each be assessed by a 6,000 word written assignment heavily based on in-school research that trainees undertake. The 15-credit honours-level module will be assessed by an assignment focusing on data collection methods in the school environment. Location Students undertake placements in secondary schools that work in partnership with King’s College London. Partnership schools are located across central London and the Greater London area. Whilst every effort is made to place PGCE trainees in local schools, due to the changing nature of initial teacher education and limited availability of placements in certain subject areas, trainees should be prepared to travel to their placement schools throughout the Greater London area and beyond. Students also organise their own short placement at a state primary school. Further information on this short placement is provided during the course. The PGCE Physics with Mathematics provides a clear, thoughtful and critical introduction to teaching science, drawing on leading education research carried out at King’s. We work in close partnership with schools in designing, delivering and assessing our course in order to develop excellent, reflective classroom practitioners.

Therefore, modules offered may change. We suggest you keep an eye on the course finder on our website for updates. Applications must be made online using King’s online application portal apply.kcl.ac.uk and a non-refundable application fee of £55 applies. Completed applications (which will normally consist of an online application form, two references and a transcript of previous degrees) will be considered on a \"first come first served\" basis according to the date of completion of the application. Applications will be initially considered by two academic members of staff. The initial decision will be to either confirm the offer of a place without an interview, invite you for an interview, hold your application for further consideration following the official closing date for applications or reject. It is expected that the majority of applicants offered a place will be required to attend an interview beforehand, although a telephone interview will be offered for overseas candidates. You should expect to receive this initial decision within three weeks of the date of completion of the application, although this may be slightly longer at peak periods near to the closing date.

For information on rates and eligibility please visit  getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/funding-and-salary/overview  or contact the King’s Admissions Office. King’s will automatically assess your eligibility for a bursary when a place on a PGCE course is offered. King’s will apply for the funding on your behalf once the terms of your offer have been met and you have enrolled on the course.   Teaching You can typically expect: The equivalent of over 50 days of academic sessions at King’s (typically three hours in the morning and/or afternoon spread throughout the academic year) Approximately 120 days of teaching placement.* This includes a short period of placement in primary schools (typically four days) Five to seven tutorials across the year Two visits from a tutor whilst on placement to observe lessons and monitor progress Regular** meetings with a mentor, who will be a member of staff at your placement school, whilst on placement Written feedback on all credit-bearing assignments within four weeks of the deadline. * This 120 day figure represents the standard number of placement days. In certain cases, following assessment by course tutors and mentors, students may be required to undertake a greater number of placement days to demonstrate their ability to meet the Teacher Standards. ** Typically each trainee will have a meeting with their mentor during each week they are on placement. In certain circumstances the frequency may vary. The types of learning commitment encompassed within the course vary depending on modules. For this course one credit represents the equivalent of 10 hours of learning and engagement The breakdown below gives you an idea of the likely workload you can expect: Professional Practice in Education (45-credit module): This module covers the teaching practice that students carry out in secondary schools. As such, much of the time commitment is dedicated to teaching and planning lessons.  Seminars/Tutorials: 14 contact hours (seminars/tutorials designed to evaluate teaching performance and provide feedback). Teaching: 200-220 hours of teaching (this includes time teaching by oneself and ‘team teaching’ in groups). Self study/assignment work: 216 hours to include lesson planning, observing lessons, marking pupils work.   School Data (15-credit module): Lectures/seminars: 10 contact hours. Self-study/assignment work: 140 hours.   Studying Policy & Professional Practice (30-credit module): Lectures/seminars: 25.5 contact hours. Self-study/assignment work: 274.5 hours.   Focused Pedagogical Studies (30-credit module): Lectures/seminars: 200 contact hours. Self-study/assignment work: 100 hours.   Assessment The 45-credit honours-level module will be assessed by a combination of a written portfolio (equivalent to 8,000 words) and assessment of your teaching practice against the Teaching Standards as set out by the government’s Department for Education. Progress in meeting the teaching standards will be monitored through three progress reports that will be completed by staff at the placement school. The 30-credit master’s-level modules will each be assessed by a 6,000 word written assignment heavily based on in-school research that trainees undertake. The 15-credit honours-level module will be assessed by an assignment focusing on data collection methods in the school environment. Location Students undertake placements in secondary schools that work in partnership with King’s College London. Partnership schools are located across central London and the Greater London area. Whilst every effort is made to place PGCE trainees in local schools, due to the changing nature of initial teacher education and limited availability of placements in certain subject areas, trainees should be prepared to travel to their placement schools throughout the Greater London area and beyond. Students also organise their own short placement at a state primary school. Further information on this short placement is provided in the offer holder pack and during the course.  The PGCE Biology provides a clear, thoughtful and critical introduction to teaching Biology, drawing on leading education research carried out at King’s. We work in close partnership with schools in designing, delivering and assessing our course in order to develop excellent, reflective classroom practitioners. The course information sheet is a printable version of the information on this web page, which you can download here for PGCE Biology, and  here  for the PGCE Biology: School Direct Route Courses are divided into modules. You will normally take modules totalling 120 credits. King’s College London reviews the modules offered on a regular basis to provide up-to-date, innovative and relevant programmes of study. Therefore, modules offered may change. We suggest you keep an eye on this course page for updates.    http://www.kcl.ac.uk/sspp/departments/education/study/pgce/pgcefaqs.aspxraining courses.

For further guidance see our Biology  FAQs Key benefits Our Biology course, judged Outstanding by Ofsted, is taught by one of the strongest teams of science education tutors in the country. One reason that our PGCE was judged Outstanding is the strong research base which informs the course. In the last research assessment exercise, the department was rated as one of the top three in the UK. We work in partnership with a wide range of schools in London and beyond, providing a unique opportunity to learn how to teach a diverse range of students. During the year you will spend over 50 days at King’s and 120 days in schools. You will work with other trainees and tutors in your subject area to consider the principles and practice of teaching your subject including curriculum design, the development of materials, classroom management and lesson planning. You will also work with trainees from other subjects in a programme of lectures and seminar groups to examine a broad range of education issues. During both secondary school placements there are occasional days in college for tutorials to support and monitor progress towards the standards for Qualified Teacher Status (QTS). There are crosscurricular research tasks and assignments. There are two blocks of school experience, one starting in the autumn and the other in the spring. You will spend time observing other teachers and their classes before beginning to teach yourself. You will teach more during the second school experience than you will in the first one. During the year you will also complete a short placement in a primary school so that you can see what pupils experience before they arrive in secondary schools. The course includes residential fieldwork based at the Field Studies Council centre in Surrey. There are many other opportunities for you to develop your abilities to teach beyond the classroom, in the school grounds and beyond.   https://www.kcl.ac.uk/study/postgraduate/apply/enquiry-form.aspx ","type":"PGT"},"entryTitle":"Postgraduate Certificate in Education (Biology)","sys":{"id":"006cfd35-0000-0000-0000-000000000000","uri":"/api/delivery/projects/website/entries/006cfd35-0000-0000-0000-000000000000","projectId":"website","contentTypeId":"courses","dataFormat":"entry","language":"en-GB","metadata":{},"properties":{},"version":{"createdBy":"SearchDataImport","created":"2018-01-26T18:03:35.091277Z","modifiedBy":"SearchDataImport","modified":"2018-01-26T18:03:35.091277Z","publishedBy":"SearchDataImport","published":"2018-01-26T18:03:35.4506656Z","versionNo":"1.0"},"owner":"SearchDataImport"}}]}
