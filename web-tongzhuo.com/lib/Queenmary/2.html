                <h3>Details</h3>This is an exciting opportunity for a PhD studentship within the supportive learning environment of the Unit for Social and Community Psychiatry and a vibrant and established arts therapies service at East London NHS Foundation Trust (rated ‘outstanding’ by the CQC). Applications are invited for a three year PhD studentship to support an ambitious student with a strong background in the arts therapies, psychology and NHS mental health services. Applicants should have a good Honours degree in Psychology (minimum 2(i) or equivalent), recognised clinical qualification in one of the four arts therapies (art, dance movement, drama or music therapy), HCPC registration (art, drama and music therapy) or UKCP registration (dance movement therapy) and experience of working in and conducting research within NHS mental health services. Experience of working with a larger research team would be advantageous.
                <br>
                <br> The aim of the project is to develop a decision making tool for group arts therapies in secondary mental health care. Whilst many of the therapeutically effective processes are common to all arts therapies modalities, for any arts therapy to have an effect, patients need to engage with the group and the art form used. The appeal of art forms and patient preferences vary from person to person. As suggested by recent arts therapies trials, a poor match of preference and the offered art form is likely to lead to poorer attendance and – even in attending patients – poorer outcomes. A similar picture is seen in wider psychological treatment, where lack of preference matching has been associated with lower perceived benefit from treatment.
                <br>
                <br> The 5-year forward view for mental health emphasises the central importance of choice and personalisation in recovery. Despite this recognition, to date, little attention has been paid to the development of decision making tools to elicit patient preferences. Within the arts therapies, information is usually provided using written leaflets and visual aids. However, this does not fully depict what the actual engagement and experience of attending an arts therapy group might be like. Use of audio-visual decision making aids (such as a brief video) may provide a better understanding of what happens, and may assist patients in eliciting their preferred arts modality.
                <br>
                <br> This PhD studentship will enable a better understanding of how to elicit patient preferences for group arts therapies, develop a decision making tool for patients to choose their preferred art-form and will test whether provision of such a decision-making tool is associated with engagement with group arts therapies and clinical outcomes. The project has potential to link with existing and upcoming arts therapies research within East London NHS Foundation Trust and will take place within the Unit for Social and Community Psychiatry- a WHO collaborating Centre for Mental Health Services Development within Queen Mary University of London.

                <h3>Details</h3>his is an exciting opportunity for a PhD studentship within the supportive learning environment of the Unit for Social and Community Psychiatry. Applications are invited for a three year PhD studentship to support an ambitious student with a strong background in the psychology and NHS mental health services. Applicants should have a good Honours degree in Psychology (minimum 2(i) or equivalent), experience of conducting group-based interventions within the NHS and experience of working in and conducting research within mental health services. Experience of working with a larger research team would be advantageous.
                <br>
                <br> The PhD aims to explore how evidence-based talking therapy (Cognitive Behavioural Therapy) can be applied to virtual reality (VR) groups. It will further assess the acceptability and feasibility of conducting a CBT group for the treatment of depression using VR technology. To achieve this aim, the project will answer the following four research questions:
                <br>
                <br> 1. How an evidence-based talking group treatment for depression may be delivered through VR e.g. what the exact format and method may be.
                <br> 2. How key stakeholders want VR groups to be administered e.g. intensity, duration, frequency
                <br> 3. To what extent is VR group treatment acceptable and feasible for people with a diagnosis of depression?
                <br> 4. What are the experiences of patients who use VR for groups?
                <br>
                <br> It is anticipated that the project will consist of four interlinked work packages to address these questions. Work package 1 will include a literature review to identify how VR has been used to treat depression, and will further identify how CBT has been delivered via VR. This will be followed by a qualitative study including interviews and focus groups with individuals with depression and CBT therapists to understand how CBT could be pragmatically implemented in VR groups (Work Package 2). The findings of these two work packages will be used to develop guidance on how VR can be used to deliver CBT. The intervention developed will then be tested in a small proof of concept study with individuals with depression. Quantitative measures will used to assess outcomes before and after the intervention (Work Package 3), and qualitative interviews used to understand the experience of the groups, including ideas and suggestions for improvements (Work Package 4).

We aim to develop these methods through the exploitation of reactive intermediates, as these species afford unique and powerful opportunities to control challenging new chemical and biological processes.
                <br>
                <br> Building on preliminary work in our group, this project will focus on the use of arynes to access a range of biologically active benzo-fused 7-membered heterocyclic compounds in a single complexity-generating step from simple and readily available reagents. These new methods will afford opportunities to generate diverse substrate libraries based on the core heterocyclic motifs adorned with functionality typically associated with pharmaceutical and agrochemical activity; the properties of these new compounds will then be tested.

                <h3>Details</h3>PROJECT OVERVIEW
                <br> Accurate chromosome segregation relies on the stable inheritance of functional centromeres through generations. A key determinant of centromere function is the histone H3 variant CENP-A (Centromere Protein A), that epigenetically marks and specifies active centromeres. CENP-A is highly conserved throughout evolution. Interestingly however, the factors that promote assembly of CENP-A, and the CCAN (Constitutive Centromere Associated Network) proteins that act as a scaffold linking the centromere to the kinetochore, are not fully conserved. A further layer of complexity comes from the striking differences in the cell cycle timing of CENP-A assembly in different species, with some organisms depositing CENP-A in G1 while others in G2 or S. The underlying basis for these significant evolutionary differences within the machinery that underpins chromosome segregation, which is fundamental to cell division in all eukaryotes, remains poorly understood. This PhD project will adopt synthetic and interdisciplinary approaches to carefully dissect the similarities and differences in centromeric chromatin inheritance between S. pombe and related species with regional centromeres. The project will enable us to define the composition and features of a ’Minimal Centromere’ in a simple model eukaryote such as yeast.
                <br>

                <h3>Details</h3>A postgraduate researchstudentship is available for a project on cognitive and behavioural differences in male and female chicks of the domestic fowl. The project will be carried out in the School of Biological and Chemical Sciences’ department of Biological and Experimental Psychology at Queen Mary University of London (UK) under the supervision of Dr Elisabetta Versace.
                <br>
                <br> In species such as human beings and chickens, newborn animals of both sexes appear very similar and clearly differentiate only later in development. When do males and females start to behave differently? To which extent are differences between sexes in cognition and behaviour determined by experience or pre-programmed? Which kind of experiences are processed differently by males and females, and how? Chicks of the domestic fowl (Gallus gallus) are ideal candidates to investigate these questions. First, their motor system is mature soon after hatching, and chicks can be easily raised in a controlled environment until the moment of test. Second, chicks are masters in filial imprinting and can promptly learn from the environment, thus constituting an excellent model to investigate differences in learning and social behaviour. By using automated systems, it is now possible to investigate the development and change of behavioural responses in chicks for many days, with unprecedented precision and objectivity (Anderson, Perona 2004), and the project will take advantage of these techniques.
                <br>
                <br> Early differences between males and females have been recently observed in pheasants after one week of age (Whiteside et al. 2017) but the onset and origin of these differences are unkown. Moreover, differences in imprinting (e.g. Versace et al. 2017), as well as differences in social behaviour (e.g. Vallortigara 1992) between the sexes have been repeatedly documented but it is not clear why these differences arise and by which cognitive differences are mediated.
                <br>
                <br> The aims of this project are:
                <br> (i) investigate the onset of male-female differences in (a) early predispositions, (b) learning, (c) social behavior
                <br> (ii) identify the role of predisposed mechanisms and experience in these differences to evaluate the role of genetic and environmental components.
                <br>
                <br> Methods: laboratory behavioural observations, automated tracking.
                <br>
                <br> The successful applicant will focus on specific aspects of spontaneous behaviours and learning, in line with her/his own interests and skills. The project is well integrated with the work of other research groups and will benefit from collaborations inside and outside the campus.
                <br>
                <br> Location: Our group is based in the School of Biological and Chemical Sciences’ department of Biological and Experimental Psychology at Queen Mary University and collaborates with other groups within the School. Queen Mary is a Russell Group University, a college of the University of London and located in London’s vibrant East End (10 min bicycle ride to Tower Bridge; 10 min walking to Victoria Park; 30 min walking to Shoreditch nightlife).
                <br>
                <br> Eligibility: The studentship is open to UK and EU applicants. Applications are invited from self-motivated, outstanding candidates with, or expecting to receive, a first or upper-second class honours degree in an area relevant to the project (e.g. Biology, Psychology, Computer Science). A Master’s degree is desirable, but not essential. Capacity to work independently as well is in a team are essential. Programming skills and/or experience with animal models are highly desirable. Students outside the UK are required to provide evidence of their proficiency in English language skills.
                <br>
                <br> Informal enquiries are strongly encouraged. Contact Dr Elisabetta Versace by email (<a href="javascript:void(0)" class="emailLink" data-email-addr="16bc95b2c45057fa301788ea004c52b46601c40df48d8d8784dc278e5a30de29" data-email-name="e.versace@qmul.ac.uk" data-stattype="2">e.versace@qmul.ac.uk</a>) with your enquiry and a full CV.

                <h3>Details</h3>PROJECT
                <br> Biocatalysis underpins metalloenzyme chemistry and is essential for processes such as respiration and photosynthesis. The Roessler group studies the biochemical and biophysical reactions of metalloenzymes at the nanoscale, using spectroscopy, electrochemistry and biochemical methods. Gaining insight into these reactions is not only of great value to our fundamental understanding of how biological systems carry out some of the most difficult chemical transformations known, but are also essential for guiding medical studies and providing technological inspiration. We are interested in deciphering how electrons travel through these metalloenzymes in order to effectuate catalysis efficiently and prevent unwanted side-reactions. In particular, unpaired electrons - spins – can provide detailed insight into the structure-function properties that underlie the mechanisms of very large and complex enzymes such as mitochondrial complex I, an enzyme that we all rely on for the production of ATP. The Jones group is interested in developing new synthetic organic chemistry methodology and are experienced in the design and synthesis of a range of small organic molecules, notably heterocycles that can form the core of myriad pharmaceutical and agrochemical compounds.
                <br>
                <br> In this project we will be combining the expertise in the Roessler and Jones groups to investigate a key step in the mechanism of mitochondrial complex I (one of the largest and most enigmatic enzymes known) from a new perspective. We will design and synthesise small organic molecules that serve as substrate mimics for the enzyme and are capable of stabilising unpaired electrons in a mechanistically key location, allowing for the interrogation of their environment using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, a technique whose fundamental concepts are analogous to NMR.
                <br>
                <br> RESEARCH ENVIRONMENT
                <br> The PhD student will join two vibrant and well-funded growing research groups that share a common lab space in a modern building and work in a collaborative, international and multi-disciplinary research environment. The student will receive training in a number of biochemical and biophysical techniques as well as synthetic organic chemistry, and will be given the opportunity to attend international conferences. Moreover, the Roessler laboratory will host a major international EPR conference in 2018 that the candidate would have the opportunity to be involved in.

                <br>
                <br> Aneuploidy (incorrect number of chromosomes) is a hallmark of aggressive cancers, but the underlying molecular cause is unclear. The PhD student will aim to discover molecular mechanisms that prevent aneuploidy in human cells.
                <br>
                <br> When a cell divides into two, its microtubules must properly capture each chromosome at specialised multi-protein structures called kinetochores. Therefore, to understand how aneuploidy arises, we should understand how kinetochores are captured by microtubules. Recent high-resolution microscopy work in the Draviam group showed that kinetochores are first captured along microtubule walls and then brought to microtubule-ends. This is an important cellular event because when the kinetochore is not tethered to microtubule-ends, the growth and shrinkage of microtubule-ends can not push or pull chromosomes.
                <br>
                <br> The PhD student will investigate:
                <br> a) how microtubules capture and move kinetochores and;
                <br> b) how microtubules impart adequate forces to pull apart chromosomes into two equal sets.
                <br>
                <br> The student will be trained in state-of-art high-resolution live-cell microscopy, biochemistry and molecular biology techniques.
                <br>
                <br> A brief work plan is listed below:
                <br> 1-15 months: The student will generate mutants of outer-kinetochore proteins that interact with microtubules. By expressing these mutants in human cells, the student will determine whether the mutant causes defective segregation of chromosomes.
                <br>
                <br> 15-30 months: The student will choose mutant phenotypes from year-1 for live-cell analysis for analysing changes in microtubule-mediated pulling of kinetochore and chromosome-microtubule attachment status.
                <br>
                <br> 30-36 months: The student will generate a written thesis of all successful experiments that help understand kinetochore structure and function.
                <br>
                <br> This multi-disciplinary project is ideal for students interested in working at the interface of cancer and basic biology research.

Applicants wishing to apply for PhD funding through external scholarship providers such as the China Scholarship Council, Ciência sem Fronteiras, CONACYT, the Pakistani Higher Education Commission or the Islamic Development Bank are welcomed (details of QMUL’s international funding partners can be found at <a class="noWrap inheritFont" onclick="faustat.addstats('PHD',199,92801); ga('send', 'event', 'DeptID=1316', 'Referral: Text Hyperlinks (API)', 'PJID=92801#', {'nonInteraction': 1});" href="https://www.findaphd.com/common/clickCount.aspx?theid=92801&amp;type=199&amp;DID=1316&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.qmul.ac.uk%2fpostgraduate%2fresearch%2ffunding_phd%2finternational-scholarships%2findex.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.qmul.ac.uk/postgraduate/research/funding_phd/international-scholarships/index.html</a>).
                <br>
                <br> Background: the research activity of Dr. Fornili’s group is focused on the computational modelling of structural and dynamical properties of proteins involved in heart contraction. At the molecular level, heart contraction arises from the complex motions of proteins that compose the sarcomere, the basic repeating unit of heart muscle cells. The normal functioning of the heart relies on the correct regulation and coordination of these motions, so that amino acid mutations affecting single proteins can damage the whole sarcomeric machinery. Indeed, a large number of mutations in sarcomeric proteins have been linked to inherited cardiac diseases.
                <br> The identification of new therapies for cardiomyopathies relies on a deep understanding of these mechanisms at the atomistic level. In particular, knowledge of the fundamental interactions that determine the protein motions could help in designing drugs that can target sarcomeric proteins and rescue their function. Using a combination of state-of-the-art Molecular Modelling, Molecular Dynamics and Bioinformatics techniques, the successful candidate will investigate how cardiomyopathy-related mutations affect the motion and stability of key components of the cardiac sarcomere.
                <br>
                <br> Techniques and Training: the successful candidate will be trained in a wide range of computational techniques for the study of biomolecules, including Homology Modelling of protein structures, basic and advanced Molecular Dynamics simulation techniques and Structural Bioinformatics tools. Moreover, the student will gain experience in Unix-based operating systems and in scripting and programming languages for biomolecular analyses. The training will also include the development of skills essential for career progression, including management of research projects, presentation and writing skills.
                <br>
                <br> Environment: Queen Mary University of London (QMUL) is a member of the Russell group and is one of the leading research-focused institutions in the UK. QMUL has been ranked 9th among multi-faculty institutions in the UK for research impact in the last Research Excellence Framework (REF) exercise. All PhD students and Post-doctoral researchers are part of the QMUL Doctoral College, which provides support with high-quality training and career development activities.
                <br> Computational research at QMUL is supported by the shared High Performance Computing facility Apocrita, a 260+ nodes fully-managed supercomputer with more than 4,000 cores for parallel calculations. Dr. Fornili’s lab also hosts state-of-the-art equipment optimised for the production and storage of biomolecular simulation data.
                <br>
                <br> Eligibility: Applications are invited from candidates with, or expecting to be awarded, at least an upper-second class degree in Chemistry, Biochemistry, Physics, Biophysics or related disciplines. Previous experience in molecular modelling/simulation and/or computer programming is desirable but not essential. International students are required to provide evidence of their proficiency in English language skills.

                <h3>Details</h3>
                <h2>Project</h2> One of the greatest challenges facing the developing world is increasing population, with no corresponding increase in available agricultural land for food and biofuel crops. It is therefore becoming paramount to find ways of growing crops and other useful plants on marginal land, and in stressful conditions (high salinity, drought, etc.). Primary productivity and crop yield are dependent on efficient photosynthesis. Modern cyanobacteria contain several stress resistance mechanisms that have been lost during the evolution of higher plant chloroplasts, and using synthetic biology to reintroduce these genes to improve stress tolerance is therefore timely. One example is the small electron transfer protein flavodoxin (Fld), which confers tolerance to a broad range of stresses when expressed in plants. The mechanism by which Fld confers stress tolerance remains unknown, and one possibility that has not been addressed so far is through electron donation to the chloroplast NAD(P)H dehydrogenase-like complex (NDH). Loss-of-function NDH mutants display altered leaf levels of reactive oxygen species and delayed senescence. Although many NDH subunits have been identified in genetic studies and increase in NDH abundance dramatically influences electron transport, very little is understood about the function of NDH, and no biophysical studies are reported.
                <br>
                <br> Our goal is to define the function of genes that enhance plant stress tolerance by combining expertise in biophysics, biochemistry and genetics. A key milestone in achieving this goal lies in understanding the function and mechanism of the NDH complex in both cyanobacteria and higher plants. In this project, we will: (1) identify the specific electron donors to the NDH-like complex and characterize these interactions, establishing the correct partner proteins for optimal NDH function (2) characterize the energy landscape within the NDH, using native NDH and custom made mutant complexes, (3) introduce genes that promise to enhance stress tolerance, first to the model plant tobacco, and then to commercially important crops (in collaboration with Prof. Nestor Carrillo, Rosario, Argentina).

                <h3>Details</h3>Currently, the prevalence of loneliness is increasing in the UK. Loneliness is associated with depression and a subjective sense of social exclusion (Mental Health Foundation). The hallmark of this subjective feeling of exclusion is a difficulty in making eye contact. Successfully communicating individuals accurately decipher non-verbal cues such as ‘where’ others are looking (their direction of gaze) as an important cue for social interaction. Recently the Bahrami et al. showed that the gaze perception accuracy is predictive of self-reported level of loneliness. Moreover, the study showed that the individual variations in the accuracy of gaze perception and the loneliness level were both associated with variations in the same human brain structures. We wish to examine these associations in depth by determining the spatiotemporal aspects of gaze processing that are impaired in people suffering from loneliness and the knock on effects this may have for decision making. Specifically, we ask: does poor or inaccurate encoding of when others make eye contact exacerbate the sensation of loneliness and does this affect our ability to make informed decisions?
                <br>
                <br> Methodology: We will employ psychophysical methods to test whether people who suffer from loneliness are poorer at encoding the spatiotemporal characteristics of social stimuli than people who do not report being lonely. We seek to identify the critical spatiotemporal characteristics of social cues, such as perceiving ‘when’ another person looks at you, that mediate the (apparent) impairment of social interaction and increased sensation of exclusion in loneliness. We will examine how this impaired spatiotemporal characteristics for gaze and social interactions impact perfromance on social and non social tasks.
                <br>
                <br> The hosting institution will be Queen Mary University of London and the research will mainly be conducted there. Dr Bahador Bahrami, based at the institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, will collaborate on the project and there will be weekly meetings to track and update the results. The research facilities at QM (testing cubicles, eye tracker, EEG setup, developmental lab) available to Dr Mareschal and her team are outstanding. Moreover both Dr Mareschal and Dr Bahrami have strong ties to UCL psychology and participate in meetings and journal clubs held there.

                    <h3>Funding Notes</h3>Excellent applicants will be able to apply for a highly competitive ESRC Doctoral Training Center fellowship. A Masters degree with distinction, or evidence of publications, is desirable for this. There are also a number of funding opportunities that you may be eligible to apply for outside of Queen Mary. If no external funds are secured, students should be able to demonstrate that they can cover the cost of living expenses and tuition fees for a minimum of 3.5 years. However, the School does offer a limited number of tuition fee only scholarships for excellent applicants that we can discuss.
