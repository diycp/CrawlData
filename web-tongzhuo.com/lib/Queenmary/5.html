                <p>The closing date for Herchel Smith scholarship award applications is <strong>Friday 1st June 2018</strong>. Only applicants who have completed the online application process to the PhD programme (including the submission of all required supporting documents) prior to the funding submission deadline will be considered for funding.</p>

                <h2><strong>Eligibility</strong></h2>
                <p></p>
                <p>To apply for a Herchel Smith Scholarship you must:</p>
                <p><strong>•	Meet the PhD programme entry requirements.</strong>
                    <br>All applicants must meet the Law PhD programme entry requirements, these include high academic performance in taught postgraduate degrees in a law or law-related subject (a ‘Pass with Distinction' on an LLM degree, in the UK marking system, for example).</p>
                <p>• Be (or apply to be) a<strong> full time postgraduate PhD research student. </strong>The award is for new applicants looking to enrol in September 2018. Therefore, existing PhD students are not eligible.</p>
                <p><strong>•	Be able to start your PhD in September 2018</strong>. Given that most LLM courses in the UK end with graduation in November (and that PhD entry is dependent upon applicants obtaining a certain grade on their LLM so as to meet our academic entry requirements), so this means current LLM students who will graduate in November 2018 aren't eligible to apply for this award this year (unless they have previously graduated from an LLM degree taken earlier).</p>

                <h3>Details</h3>The School of Mathematical Sciences of Queen Mary University of London invite applications for a PhD project commencing either in September 2018 for students seeking funding, or at any point in the academic year for self-funded students. The deadline for funded applications is the 31st of January 2018.
                <br>
                <br> This project will be supervised by Dr Abhishek Saha.
                <br>
                <br> The goal of this project is to better understand the properties of automorphic forms of higher rank, especially in situations involving high ramification. Automorphic forms are central objects in the Langlands program, a vast web of theorems and conjectures that connects concepts coming from number theory, representation theory and geometry. The simplest examples of automorphic forms include Dirichlet characters and classical modular forms, both of which have proved to be of profound importance in modern mathematics. More generally, automorphic forms are complex valued functions that can be naturally viewed as vectors inside representations known as automorphic representations. This viewpoint allows one to associate automorphic forms to any reductive algebraic group. From a different point of view, automorphic forms include (as special cases) eigenfunctions of Laplacians on arithmetic manifolds. This viewpoint allows one to bring in a whole range of additional perspectives coming from analysis, spectral theory and quantum mechanics. Automorphic forms and the L-functions attached to them have been key ingredients in the solutions of many famous and difficult problems, such as Wiles’ proof of Fermat’s last Theorem and Duke’s work on the representations of algebraic integers by ternary quadratic forms.
                <br>
                <br> A central theme in modern number theory is to understand key properties of automorphic forms and their associated L-functions as one or more of their defining parameters vary. The finite or non-archimedean part of these parameters can be captured by a fundamental arithmetic quantity called the conductor or level (henceforth denoted by N) that measures its total ramification (or complexity at finite primes). The level appears in the functional equation of the attached L-function, as well as (essentially) describes the arithmetic manifold that the automorphic form lives on. Compared to the archimedean aspect, there has been relatively little progress in the level aspect versions of analytic problems about automorphic forms, especially in higher rank.
                <br>
                <br> In this project, the student will investigate key questions related to the themes described above. The tools used will be a mix of algebraic as well as analytic number theory, together with representation theory of p-adic groups. The specfic problems to be solved will depend on the interests of the student (possible examples include sup-norms and other L^p norms, period formulas, etc.)
                <br>

                <br>
                <br> Everybody is talking about Tao’s algebraic regularity lemma. In every area of mathematical research, from (algebraic) combinatorics, model theory (logic), number theory and algebraic geometry, researchers are finding new and inventive ways of using it and finding new instances and analogues of it.
                <br>
                <br> In short, Tao’s regularity lemma is a variant of the celebrated Szemeredi’s regularity lemma (which is a result for arbitrary graphs) that works for graphs that can be defined over the so-called pseudofinite fields (or uniformly over finite fields). It says that such a graph can be decomposed into pieces roughly about the same size so that the edges between those pieces behave almost randomly.

                <br> Calibration is the process of using physical data to estimate the tuning parameters in computational models. This PhD project will help to quantify how confident we can be about the outcomes of using a computer model for cardiac electrophysiology models by first quantifying our confidence in the clinical recordings and measuring biological variability. This knowledge is essential if the model is used to guide clinical decision-making to ensure patient safety. This project will be carried out in collaboration with a team at Imperial College London.

                <br> Clustering models are used to identify subsets of the data such that objects in the same group (called a cluster) are more similar, in some sense, to each other than to those in other clusters. Many widely used clustering models are defined by a set of parameters, whose uncertainty can be quantified. However, the output of a clustering model is a partition – the allocation of each object to clusters – and the uncertainty of the partition as a whole is usually overlooked, due to the size and complexity of the partition space. The aims of this PhD project are to develop a framework for calculating partition uncertainty for clustering methods and to develop methods to communicate the partition uncertainty effectively to end users.

                <br> This project will be supervised by Dr Justin Ward.
                <br>
                <br> This project conceerns the development and analysis of new optimisation heuristics and algorithms with provable, worst-case guarantees for practical problems arising in operational research, data science, and machine learning.
                <br>
                <br> Combinatorial optimisation problems involve selecting the best collection of items that satisfy some property; for example: the cheapest set of edges that form a spanning tree in an underlying graph, or the cheapest tour that visits some set of cities exactly once. While many optimisation problems arising in practice are NP-hard to solve optimally, it is often possible to design efficient algorithms that guarantee almost optimal solutions. The study of such algorithms thus involves a finer-grained hierarchy for studying the difficulty of NP-hard problems.
                <br>
                <br> Intuitively, the reason that many combinatorial optimisation problems are hard to solve is because they are formulated over a discrete rather than a continuous space. A common approach for handling such problems is to extend (or relax) the discrete constraints into a continuous space, and then apply well-known tools from linear programming or convex optimisation to solve this relaxation. This general technique is remarkably powerful and has been used to obtain many state-of-the-art algorithms for a wide variety of combinatorial optimisation problems. On the other hand, many classical results in the study of optimisation involve combinatorial algorithms (for example, the "greedy" strategy) that work directly on the discrete space. These algorithms are often easier to implement and apply. This is especially true for problems involving massive datasets, where distributed approaches are necessary. As part of this project, you may investigate one or more of the following three related questions: (1) Can we obtain the best of both worlds, by incorporating new insights from continuous optimisation into the design of combinatorial algorithms? Possible candidates for such techniques include packing problems, clustering problems, and problems that involve optimisation in the face of "diminishing returns." (2) Can we formally quantify and understand the limits of current combinatorial algorithms? (3) Can we use our insights to develop faster algorithms for large-scale problems?

                <br> Despite its simple to describe construction, the hypercube has a surprisingly complicated structure and there are many tantalising open questions about it. Many questions in extremal set theory are naturally expressed in terms of the hypercube. Graph theoretic concepts such as isoperimetric inequalities and Ramsey results often have interesting analogues in the context of the hpercube. Properties of the hypercube have found application in social choice, computer science and coding theory, often leading to further mathematical problems.

                <h3>Details</h3>The School of Mathematical Sciences of Queen Mary University of London invite applications for a PhD project commencing either in September 2018 for students seeking funding, or at any point in the academic year for self-funded students. The deadline for funded applications is the 31st of January 2018.
                <br>
                <br> This project will be supervised by Dr Steve Lester.
                <br>
                <br> This project aims to further understand the analytic behaviour of L-functions and modular forms. In particular, the goal is to understand how the values of L-functions and modular forms are distributed and give potential applications to arithmetic, or, mathematical physics. L-functions and modular appear prominently in modern number theory and also arise in other areas of mathematics. The analytic proper-ties of these functions are closely related to arithmetic problems involving the distribution of the prime numbers, lattice points, and structure of elliptic curves. For instance, important problems such as the Generalised Riemann Hypothesis and Birch-Swinnerton Dyer Conjecture are directly related to the theory of these functions.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br> Specific problems will follow the interests of the student and possible topics may include, the distribution of zeros of Hecke cusp forms, moment estimates for families of quadratic twists of modular L-functions, random model approximations of families of L-functions, and equidistribution of mass of automorphic forms.
                <br>
                <br> Part of the project could potentially explore profound connections Between L-functions and modular forms to questions in quantum chaos, which is an sub-field of mathematical physics which studies the quan- tum dynamics of classically chaotic systems. This is an especially exciting area of study that is still quite mysterious. Fascinatingly, much progress has been made in special arithmetic settings in which modular forms and L-functions play a prominent role.
                <br>
                <br> Previous exposure to analytic number theory, or, algebraic number theory would be advantageous, however not necessary and may be
                <br> learned during PhD research. Background in real and complex analysis along with probability theory and harmonic analysis would be desirable.
                <br>

                <br> This project will be supervised by Professor Shahn Majid.
                <br>
                <br> Noncommutative geometry was developed in recent years as an extension to geometry to allow the `coordinate algebra’ of a space to be noncommutative and/or for differential forms to not commute with coordinates. In recent years, most constructions for differential geometry, including Riemannian geometry, have been formulated algebraically and can be applied over any field. The project will construct a new generation of models where the algebra is finite-dimensional (such as the algebra of functions on the vertices of a finite graph, or matrix algebras equipped with further structure) with an aim towards classification. Some computer methods will likely be needed as models can be complicated to solve by hand, but after that the project can either go towards pure mathematics such as `finite Lie theory’ or results in graph theory, or it can go towards applied mathematics, such as finite models of quantum gravity (depending on the interests of the student).

                <br>
                <br> Geometric Analysis, and in particular Geometric Flows, led to some of the most important breakthroughs in pure mathematics in the last decades. This modern area of mathematics combines Differential Geometry (algebraic structures of geometric objects and local control of geometric properties such as curvature) with tools from Analysis (mainly partial differential equations and the calculus of variations) to obtain global differential topological results. As the partial differential equations that are involved are generally non-linear, they often give rise to singularities. In many interesting problems, it is important to understand when and how these singularities occur and to study precise characterisations of them.
                <br>
                <br> An illustrative example is the so-called Ricci Flow. This Geometric Flow evolves an initial manifold towards an object with more symmetries, e.g. a potato-shaped surface is transformed to a perfectly round sphere. In more general situations however, the flow develops local singularities where the curvature becomes infinitely large while staying bounded in other regions. Due to Perelman’s ground-breaking work - for which he won a Clay Millennium Prize and a Fields Medal - the singularity formation in dimension three is now quite well understood and this led to full proofs of the Poincare Conjecture and Thurston’s Geometrisation Conjecture. Similar results in higher dimensions are much harder to obtain and are an important active field of research.
                <br>
                <br> Dr. Reto Buzano (born Reto Mueller) and Dr. Huy The Nguyen both study the singularity formation in Ricci Flow, as well as other geometric flows such as Mean Curvature Flow, Willmore Flow, or Harmonic Ricci Flow, or related topics in Geometric Analysis. Various PhD projects under their supervision are available, including for example "High codimension Mean Curvature Flow", "Willmore surfaces in Riemannian manifolds", or "Singular metrics with constant Q-curvature".
                <br>
                <br> With a very active research group in Geometric Analysis (currently involving Reto Buzano, Huy Nguyen, Arick Shao, as well as three PhD students and two visiting students) as well as with a strong relativity group to interact with and other London universities with active research in Analysis and Geometry in close proximity, Queen Mary University of London has become one of the most interesting places to pursue a PhD in Geometric Analysis. We strongly encourage applications of motivated candidates with a strong background in at least one of the two fields of Analysis and Geometry. If interested, please contact Reto Buzano or Huy Nguyen by e-mail for further information and advice on the application procedure.
