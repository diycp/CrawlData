                <h3>Details</h3>The School of Mathematical Sciences of Queen Mary University of London invite applications for a PhD project commencing either in September 2018 for students seeking funding, or at any point in the academic year for self-funded students. The deadline for funded applications is the 31st of January 2018.
                <br>
                <br> This project will be supervised by Dr David Ellis.
                <br>
                <br> Extremal Combinatorics is a relatively young area of mathematics; as many students will know, it was founded in earnest by a
                <br> group of mainly Hungarian mathematicians in the early 1900s, and was given huge impetus by Paul Erdos and his collaborators.
                <br>
                <br> There has been much exciting progress in extremal combinatorics in recent years, utilising techniques both from combinatorics itself, and also from other areas of mathematics such as algebra, analysis and probability theory. This PhD project would involve gaining familiarity with research-level techniques in combinatorics, and simultaneously tackling some unsolved problems in extremal combinatorics.
                <br>

                <br> This project will be supervised by Dr Juan Valiente-Kroon.
                <br>
                <br> One of the outstanding challenges in General Relativity —the relativistic theory of gravity—is to gain analytic control of the solutions to the Einstein field equations in the large: physical questions in General Relativity require knowledge of the non-linear behaviour and properties of solutions to non-linear partial differential equations. Such undertaking is, very often, only feasible in the case where the solutions under consideration are suitably close —that is, a perturbation— to an (usually) explicitly known background solution. The standard approach to this problem has been the study the evolution and properties of linearised perturbations. This approach, however, offers a limited understanding of non-linear mechanisms. The objective of the present project is to analyse fully non-linear evolution problems in a range of settings in General Relativity ranging from Cosmology to the theory of black holes. The insights gained from the study of non-linear perturbations is key to understand the physical content of General Relativity as the background solution are often attractors of the theory.
                <br>
                <br> The approach to these problems will be based on a number of techniques of conformal geometry and the theory of partial differential equations recently developed by the supervisor —see the bibliography enclosed—. The project will be mainly analytical, but it will involve certain amount of computer algebra and some numerical simulations.

                <br>
                <br> This project will be supervised by Dr Xin Li.
                <br>
                <br> Originally, one of the main motivations to introduce operator algebras was to study unitary representations of groups. And indeed, this idea turned out to be very fruitful and has led to interesting new developments as well as important open problems.
                <br>
                <br> The idea of this PhD project is to study C*-algebras, a particular class of operator algebras, attached to groups, semigroups, and groupoids. The construction of semigroup C*-algebras is of current interest. Recently, it became clear that K-theory for semigroup C*-algebras is related to the Baum-Connes conjecture, which is an important open problem in topological K-
                <br> theory. Moreover, in another direction, it has become clear that C*-algebras of groupoids provide a bridge between geometric group theory, topological dynamics, and C*-algebras. The relevant notion on the C*-algebra side is the notion of Cartan subalgebras, which is a largely undeveloped area.
                <br>
                <br> The goals of this PhD project is to explore the link between K-theory of semigroup C*-algebras and the Baum-Connes conjecture, and to study homological invariants of groupoids and Cartan subalgebras. This research project has the potential of shedding some light on long-standing open problems.At the same time, it leads to many interesting and feasible research problems.

                <h3>Details</h3>The School of Mathematical Sciences of Queen Mary University of London invite applications for a PhD project commencing either in September 2018 for students seeking funding, or at any point in the academic year for self-funded students. The deadline for funded applications is the 31st of January 2018.
                <br>
                <br> This project will be supervised by Dr Adrian Baule.
                <br>
                <br> Granular matter is ubiquitous in science and nature representing the most common state of matter after the liquid state. While granular matter seems conceptually simple, consisting of hard particles interacting solely by steric repulsion and friction, these matter states also also offer exciting new perspectives for materials design, which are only beginning to be recognized. Materials consisting of jammed athermal particles exist on all scales exhibiting varying porosity, stiffness, shear resistance, etc, which are tunable over a wide range. A deeper understanding of jamming in these systems thus opens up new opportunities to design materials with specific functionality in areas as diverse as nanoparticle aggregates and construction materials. The aim of this project is to implement machine learning strategies to identify optimal material designs from large datasets.
                <br>

                <br>
                <br> This project will be supervised by Professor Alexander Sodin.
                <br>
                <br> The project belongs to the part of spectral theory which studies the properties of operators depending on random parameters. More specifically, the focus is on random operators which inherit some geometric properties of the underlying space. One such class, known as random Schrodinger operators, is obtained by adding a random multiplication operator to a deterministic operator such as the (discrete or continuous) d-dimensional Laplacian. Other classes include random band matrices, orbital operators, and more.
                <br>
                <br> Random operators exhibit surprising connections with random matrices,statistical mechanics, and other, seemingly unrelated, random objects, such as random partitions arising in the representation theory of the symmetric group. These connections have been only partially explored. The goal of the project is to make progress in the rigorous analysis in the study of the spectral properties of random operators of various classes. The researcher will be able to benefit from collaboration with experts in adjacent fields of mathematics, particularly, probability theory, working in the department.
                <br>
                <br> The necessary material from spectral theory may be learned in the process of PhD research, however, maturity in analysis and basic probability theory will be an advantage.

                <br> The HP-model [1], which has rightfully been called the "Ising model of protein folding," serves as a benchmark model for testing the performance of algorithms attempting to compute the density of states of proteins close to their folded
                <br> ground state. This model provides an ideal testing ground for the comparison of Monte-Carlo algorithms.
                <br>
                <br> The successful applicant will implement several competing algorithms, such as the Wang-Landau Method [2], and the flat-histogram version of the Pruned and Enriched Rosenbluth Method [3], to comprehensively analyse performance of these algorithms within the context of the HP model, and to develop improvements for these algorithms.

                <h3>Details</h3>The School of Mathematical Sciences of Queen Mary University of London invite applications for a PhD project commencing either in September 2018 for students seeking funding, or at any point in the academic year for self-funded students. The deadline for funded applications is the 31st of January 2018.
                <br>
                <br> This project will be supervised by Professor Vito Latora and Professor Nejat Ambarci.
                <br>
                <br> Individuals make many choices every day such as which cereal or book to buy, or movie to see or place to have lunch at. Some of these decisions can also be very important for their lives, such as which political candidate to support or university to attend or career to pursue. Many individuals tend to think that they are making these decisions purely on their own tastes and preferences,
                <br> without realizing they actually make their choices with a huge influence of others in almost every aspect of life. People vote because others do so, eat more when others eat, buy a new car because their neighbours or friends have recently done so. Thus, social influence affects the products people buy, health plans they choose, careers they follow, and shapes whether people save for retirement, invest in the stock market, donate money to charity, save energy, or adopt new innovations. It is indeed difficult to find a decision or choice that is not affected by other people. Thus, in a broad sense, the purpose of this PhD project is the combined use of game theory and complex networks theory to understand and model how social influence affects individuals’ choices/decisions.
                <br>
                <br> The student will develop game theoretic models based on, but not limited to, the prisoner’s dilemma, the public good game and the trust game, and he will implement them within the setup of complex networks, especially networks with multiple layers and/or time-varying links. The focus will be on understanding how the network structure affects the nature of the outcomes of the games.
                <br> Different equilibrium concepts (Nash, subgame-perfect, Bayesian-Nash and perfect-Bayesian equilibria) will be used together with heterogeneous mean-field approaches to treat networks with scale-free degree distributions.
                <br>
                <br> The mathematical framework will be instrumental to face some general problems (such as understanding cumulative culture through the explicit modelling of innovation processes, which may lead to different cultural repertoires of societies under different environments and environmental changes) and also to practical applications (such as proposing novel recommendation systems to improve those already used by global companies like Amazon or Netflix to increase their sales).
                <br>
                <br> The perfect candidate will hold an MSc or an equivalent degree in applied mathematics or theoretical physics, and will have a good background in complex systems, network science, and experience with computer programming, numerical simulations as well as statistical analysis. Previous knowledge of game theory is also desirable.

                <h3>Details</h3>The School of Mathematical Sciences of Queen Mary University of London invite applications for a PhD project commencing either in September 2018 for students seeking funding, or at any point in the academic year for self-funded students. The deadline for funded applications is the 31st of January 2018.
                <br>
                <br> This project will be supervised by Dr Anna Maltsev.
                <br>
                <br> Random matrix theory is a very active field of mathematics at the intersection of analysis, probability, mathematical physics and mathematical finance with a lot of known and potential applications. In this field we seek to prove theorems which are similar to the central limit theorem. The central limit theorem states that the sample mean tends to a gaussian distribution as the sample size grows, irrespective of the original distribution of the variables. Analogously, in random matrix theory, one might start with a matrix whose entries are independent and identically distributed (called a Wigner matrix) and then examine various spectral properties of the matrix when the dimension of the matrix is large. Particularly, a major goal is to show that many of these properties do not depend on the exact probability distribution of the entries. However, like in the case of the central limit theorem, various quantities of interest change abruptly when the distribution of the entries has no variance. In some cases the abrupt change happens already when the distribution lacks a 4th moment (the heavy tailed case). While the behaviour of Wigner random matrices is very well studied when the distribution of the entries has more than 4 moments, in the case of heavier tails a lot of questions remain open. A general goal of this project will be to close some of these gaps in our understanding.
                <br>
                <br> The specific questions to be pursued in this project will depend on the interests of the student and will be decided in consultation with the supervisor. To give an example of problem that may be studied, when the distribution of the entries has a fourth moment, the eigenvalues stay very close to their expected locations. On the other hand, it is clear that in the heavy tailed case, the eigenvalues fluctuate more away from their expected location with two different regimes: one for entries with distributions that have between 2 and 4 moments and a different one for distributions which don’t have a 2nd moment. The problem here would be to investigate the magnitude and the source of this fluctuation.
